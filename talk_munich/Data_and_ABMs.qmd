# General Introduction

# Network epistemology
* Traditional epistemology focuses on individual rationality 
    - What is the proper response to evidence?
* Social epistemology broadens the perspective 
    - What is the proper *individual* response to testimony or disagreement?
    - Which properties of *groups* makes them better or worse epistemically?
* Network epistemology targets the structure of communication
    - Which communication *structures* are best?

# Network epistemology
* Kicked off by Zollman (2007, 2010) who uses agent-based modelling and simulations
* Main findings:
    - Less connectivity can lead to more reliable groups
    - There is a robust tradeoff between speed of convergence and reliability
* The ensuing literature has focused on whether and when high connectivity, convergence speed and conformity lead to epistemically better groups 

# Scale-free networks
* The existing literature typically focuses on three simplistic network structures: the cycle, wheel and complete network [INSERT PICTURES?]
* The epistemic value of modelling and simulations depends heavily on their empirical adequacy
* But, these simplistic network structures are rarely observed in the real world
* Real-world networks are often/virtually always *scale-free*: 
    - their degree distribution follows a power law (which is highly unequal)
* Our focus is on the *degree-equality effect*:
    - whether and when higher levels of degree equality leads to epistemically better groups

[INSERT PICTURE OR EXAMPLE OF A SCALE-FREE NETWORK?]

# Empirically sensitive robustness
* The overall aim of our study is to see whether and when the degree-equality effect is robust in an empirically sensitive way
* We aim to address three challenges:
    - Existing work in network epistemology focuses on small networks (typically up to 10 agents) whereas real scientific networks are much larger
    - Existing work in network epistemology focus on simple network structures even though virtually all empirical networks are scale-free
    - There are few attempts to empirically calibrate theoretical findings on artificial networks towards empirical networks
* We propose a two-pronged analysis by analysing both (a) artificial networks *and* (b) empirical networks

# Main points
* There is a significant effect of randomizing, on empirical networks. This is one philosophical conversation.
* There does not seem to be an effect in randomizing, for generated/simulated networks. This is another philosophical conversation.

# Methods
We simulate a very specific philsci scenario, namely when the community has a default theory and there is a competitor entering the game. Also this is tied to the philosophical examples we picked.
We consider randomizing networks as the main method.
We run simulations on randomly generated networks, preferential attachment (but maybe we can quickly run a few more just for completeness)


We run simulations on empirical networks.


# Results on Simulated Networks (~ 2 slides)

Show results (pretty plots are valuable here), namely now effect. (We can try a few more simulations here too)
Brief discussion on the fact that the parameter space is too big, and the simulated networks can be very different from real life networks.

# Results on Empirical Networks (~ 5 slides)

Explain the two case studies that we selected, and why.
Show visualizations of the networks, and the loglog plots. Emphasize how unequally distributed they are.
Show pretty plots of the results.
Brief discussion of what might explain the effects, as a segway to the next section.

# Discussion (~5 slides)
Proper discussion on what explains the effects, how robust the results are, and how to move forward with the research question. 
I am not entirely sure what explains the effects.
Proper discussion of the fact that how possibly explanations might be deceiving, and that empirically informed approaches are better.

# Previous Work in Network Epistemology
* The literature on network epistemology can be (roughly) divided into:
    - A strand on robustness:
        - robustness under changes in parameter settings (Rosenstock et al., 2017), 
        - robustness under changes in modelling choices (Kummerfeld & Zollman, 2016; Frey & Šešelja, 2018, 2020; 
    - A strand on conformity: (Zollman, 2010; Mohseni & Williams, 2021; Weatherall & O’Connor, 2021; Fazelpour & Steel, 2022)
    - A strand on epistemically impure agents (including financial interests) (Holman & Bruner, 2015; Weatherall, O’Connor & Bruner, 2020)
* Our work complements this literature in at least two ways
    - we focus on the degree equality effect
    - we study empirically sensitive robustness

# One Precursor

* To the best of our knowledge there is one precursor on the degree equality effect
* Zollman (2007, Sect. 3.1) finds that 
    - the wheel does better than the complete network, which suggests that degree-inequality might be epistemically beneficial. 
    - However, since the cycle does better than the wheel, he concludes that low connectivity (not degree-inequality) produces the epistemic benefits. 
* Zollman (2007, Sect. 3.2) goes on to consider all possible networks of size 6 and finds that degree-inequality is not correlated with reliability and, hence, disconfirms the degree-inequality effect.
* Our results:
    - confirm Zollman’s finding on our artificial networks
    - but disconfirms Zollman’s finding on empirical networks
