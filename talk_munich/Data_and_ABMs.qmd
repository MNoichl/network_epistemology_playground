# General Introduction

# Main points
* There is a significant effect of randomizing, on empirical networks. This is one philosophical conversation.
* There does not seem to be an effect in randomizing, for generated/simulated networks. This is another philosophical conversation.

# Methods
We simulate a very specific philsci scenario, namely when the community has a default theory and there is a competitor entering the game. Also this is tied to the philosophical examples we picked.
We consider randomizing networks as the main method.
We run simulations on randomly generated networks, preferential attachment (but maybe we can quickly run a few more just for completeness)


We run simulations on empirical networks.


# Results on Simulated Networks (~ 2 slides)

Show results (pretty plots are valuable here), namely now effect. (We can try a few more simulations here too)
Brief discussion on the fact that the parameter space is too big, and the simulated networks can be very different from real life networks.

# Results on Empirical Networks (~ 5 slides)

Explain the two case studies that we selected, and why.
Show visualizations of the networks, and the loglog plots. Emphasize how unequally distributed they are.
Show pretty plots of the results.
Brief discussion of what might explain the effects, as a segway to the next section.

# Discussion (~5 slides)
Proper discussion on what explains the effects, how robust the results are, and how to move forward with the research question. 
I am not entirely sure what explains the effects.
Proper discussion of the fact that how possibly explanations might be deceiving, and that empirically informed approaches are better.
