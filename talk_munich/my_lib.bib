The rate of preprint uploads to bioRxiv continues to grow (exceeding 2,100 in October 2018), as does the number of downloads (1.1 million in October 2018). We also find that two-thirds of preprints posted before 2017 were later published in peer-reviewed journals, and find a relationship between the number of downloads a preprint has received and the impact factor of the journal in which it is published. We also describe Rxivist.org, a web application that provides multiple ways to interact with preprint metadata.},

We compare the individual research performance of ``children'' who have ``parents'' in the same university against that of the ``non-children'' with the same academic rank and seniority, in the same field. The results show non-significant differences in performance. Analyses of career advancement show that children's research performance is on average superior to that of their colleagues who did not advance. The study's findings do not rule out the existence of nepotism, which has been actually recorded in a low percentage of cases, but do not prove either the most serious presumed consequences of nepotism, namely that relatives who are poor performers are getting ahead of non-relatives who are better performers. In light of these results, many attitudes and norms concerning parental ties in academia should be reconsidered.},

  abstract = {Thomas Hobbes is rightly regarded as a monumental figure in thehistory of philosophy, especially for his masterpieceLeviathan (1651 in English; 1668 in Latin). The scholarlyliterature on Leviathan is voluminous and has been especiallyfocused upon issues in political philosophy, such as representationand authorization, sovereignty and absolutism, contracts andcovenants, and the relationship of civil authority to religion, amongothers. Since its printing the portrayal in Leviathan XIII ofhumans in their natural state---an existence that is``solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short''---hasstruck the imagination of many of Hobbes' readers, leaving manyseeing Hobbes as pessimistic at best or hopelessly unrealistic atworst., In Hobbes' own time, however, he was also well-known, even ifsometimes ridiculed, for his views in mathematics, natural philosophy,and optics. In A Minute or First Draught of the Optiques(1646), Hobbes' own assessment of his work is laudatory:, Although some contemporaries saw promise in Hobbes' optics, suchas Mersenne, who published Hobbes' work in this area in 1644 inBallistica, in the years following the publication ofLeviathan Hobbes' pursuits apart from politicalphilosophy were taken less seriously. There are a number of possibleexplanations for this decline in the opinion of Hobbes'competence in these areas, including his numerous attempts to squarethe circle, the association of his views with atheism by many critics,and the conflicts he had with Robert Boyle at the time of the rise ofexperimental philosophy. These all contributed to some extent toHobbes' exclusion from the Royal Society when it wasfounded., If Hobbes' mathematical and natural-philosophical endeavorsfailed to be taken seriously by his contemporaries near the end of hislife, what purpose is served by understanding these failed attempts?[1] Apart from interest in them on their own terms as episodes in thehistory of science and philosophy, there are several reasons why wemay find these areas of Hobbes' thought valuable for study.First, Hobbes himself understood his political philosophy, or as hecalled it ``civil philosophy'', to be a science capable ofdemonstration. Thus, understanding his general views about the natureof scientific demonstration promises to shed light on the way in whichhe saw civil philosophy as scientific. Second, Hobbes understoodnatural-philosophical explanations in physics as needing to make useof mathematical principles to count, as he says, as ``truephysics''. This may seem like a banal claim to a twenty-firstcentury reader, but it was not so to many in the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries. Hobbes' natural philosophy thus situateshim within the shift from qualitative to quantitative physics. Third,Hobbes' conflicts with the Royal Society show us not only hisviews of the role of experimentation but also contextualize the riseof experimentalism. After discussing Hobbes' criteria forscientific knowledge, this entry will address each of these threeareas.},

Motivated by the recent successes of embeddings in natural language processing, researchers have tried to find network embeddings in order to exploit machine learning algorithms for mining tasks like node classification and edge prediction. However, most of the work focuses on distributed representations of nodes that are inherently ill-suited to tasks such as community detection which are intuitively dependent on subgraphs. Here, we formulate subgraph embedding problem based on two intuitive properties of subgraphs and propose Sub2Vec, an unsupervised algorithm to learn feature representations of arbitrary subgraphs. We also highlight the usability of Sub2Vec by leveraging it for network mining tasks, like community detection and graph classification. We show that Sub2Vec gets significant gains over state-of-the-art methods. In particular, Sub2Vec offers an approach to generate a richer vocabulary of meaningful features of subgraphs for representation and reasoning.},

In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lk norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lk norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

  abstract = {We consider the vector embedding problem. We are given a finite set of items, with the goal of assigning a representative vector to each one, possibly under some constraints (such as the collection of vectors being standardized, i.e., having zero mean and unit covariance). We are given data indicating that some pairs of items are similar, and optionally, some other pairs are dissimilar. For pairs of similar items, we want the corresponding vectors to be near each other, and for dissimilar pairs, we want the corresponding vectors to not be near each other, measured in Euclidean distance. We formalize this by introducing distortion functions, defined for some pairs of the items. Our goal is to choose an embedding that minimizes the total distortion, subject to the constraints. We call this the minimum-distortion embedding (MDE) problem. The MDE framework is simple but general. It includes a wide variety of embedding methods, such as spectral embedding, principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, dimensionality reduction methods (like Isomap and UMAP), force-directed layout, and others. It also includes new embeddings, and provides principled ways of validating historical and new embeddings alike. We develop a projected quasi-Newton method that approximately solves MDE problems and scales to large data sets. We implement this method in PyMDE, an open-source Python package. In PyMDE, users can select from a library of distortion functions and constraints or specify custom ones, making it easy to rapidly experiment with different embeddings. Our software scales to data sets with millions of items and tens of millions of distortion functions. To demonstrate our method, we compute embeddings for several real-world data sets, including images, an academic co-author network, US county demographic data, and single-cell mRNA transcriptomes.},

We investigate how well the approaches agree with a ground truth subject classification of the test documents, when the complete linkage method is used, and under two types of similarities, first-order and second-order. The results show that it is possible to achieve a very good approximation of the classification by means of automatic grouping of articles. One text-only method and one combination method, under second-order similarities in both cases, give rise to cluster solutions that to a large extent agree with the classification.},

  abstract = {Clustering is an important data mining task for exploration and visualization of different data types like news stories, scientific publications, weblogs, etc. Due to the evolving nature of these data, evolutionary clustering, also known as dynamic clustering, has recently emerged to cope with the challenges of mining temporally smooth clusters over time. A good evolutionary clustering algorithm should be able to fit the data well at each time epoch, and at the same time results in a smooth cluster evolution that provides the data analyst with a coherent and easily interpretable model. In this paper we introduce the temporal Dirichlet process mixture model (TDPM) as a framework for evolutionary clustering. TDPM is a generalization of the DPM framework for clustering that automatically grows the number of clusters with the data. In our framework, the data is divided into epochs; all data points inside the same epoch are assumed to be fully exchangeable, whereas the temporal order is maintained across epochs. Moreover, The number of clusters in each epoch is unbounded: the clusters can retain, die out or emerge over time, and the actual parameterization of each cluster can also evolve over time in a Markovian fashion. We give a detailed and intuitive construction of this framework using the recurrent Chinese restaurant process (RCRP) metaphor, as well as a Gibbs sampling algorithm to carry out posterior inference in order to determine the optimal cluster evolution. We demonstrate our model over simulated data by using it to build an infinite dynamic mixture of Gaussian factors, and over real dataset by using it to build a simple non-parametric dynamic clustering-topic model and apply it to analyze the NIPS12 document collection.},

Having a liberal professional father has a positive and statistically significant effect on the probability to complete a compulsory period of practice and to start a liberal profession; whereas there does not seem to be an effect on the type of degree chosen and on passing the licensing examination, at least after controlling for child's and parental formal human capital.},

  abstract = {The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge due to the subtle biomarker changes often overlooked. Machine learning (ML) models offer a promising tool for identifying individuals at risk of AD. However, current research tends to prioritize ML accuracy while neglecting the crucial aspect of model explainability. The diverse nature of AD data and the limited dataset size introduce additional challenges, primarily related to high dimensionality. In this study, we leveraged a dataset obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, comprising 169,408 records and 1024 features. After applying various steps to reduce the feature space. Notably, support vector machine (SVM) models trained on the selected features exhibited high performance when tested on an external dataset. SVM achieved a high F1 score of 98.9\% for binary classification (distinguishing between NC and AD) and 90.7\% for multiclass classification. Furthermore, SVM was able to predict AD progression over a 4-year period, with F1 scores reached 88\% for binary task and 72.8\% for multiclass task. To enhance model explainability, we employed two rule-extraction approaches: class rule mining and stable and interpretable rule set for classification model. These approaches generated human-understandable rules to assist domain experts in comprehending the key factors involved in AD development. We further validated these rules using SHAP and LIME models, underscoring the significance of factors such as MEMORY, JUDGMENT, COMMUN, and ORIENT in determining AD risk. Our experimental outcomes also shed light on the crucial role of the Clinical Dementia Rating tool in predicting AD.},

Principal graphs approximate the multivariate data by a graph injected into the data space with some constraints imposed on the node mapping. Here we present ElPiGraph, a scalable and robust method for constructing principal graphs. ElPiGraph exploits and further develops the concept of elastic energy, the topological graph grammar approach, and a gradient descent-like optimization of the graph topology. The method is able to withstand high levels of noise and is capable of approximating data point clouds via principal graph ensembles. This strategy can be used to estimate the statistical significance of complex data features and to summarize them into a single consensus principal graph. ElPiGraph deals efficiently with large datasets in various fields such as biology, where it can be used for example with single-cell transcriptomic or epigenomic datasets to infer gene expression dynamics and recover differentiation landscapes.},

  abstract = {The connection of edges in a graph generates a structure that is independent of a coordinate system. This visual metaphor allows creating a more flexible representation of data than a two-dimensional scatterplot. In this work, we present STAD (Spanning Trees as Approximation of Data), a dimensionality reduction method to approximate the high-dimensional structure into a graph with or without formulating prior hypotheses. STAD generates an abstract representation of high-dimensional data by giving each data point a location in a graph which preserves the distances in the original high-dimensional space. The STAD graph is built upon the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to which new edges are added until the correlation between the distances from the graph and the original dataset is maximized. Additionally, STAD supports the inclusion of additional functions to focus the exploration and allow the analysis of data from new perspectives, emphasizing traits in data which otherwise would remain hidden. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to two real-world datasets: traffic density in Barcelona and temporal measurements of air quality in Castile and Leo{\textasciiacute} n in Spain.},

  abstract = {There is a contradiction at the heart of our current understanding of individual and collective mobility patterns. On the one hand, a highly influential body of literature on human mobility driven by analyses of massive empirical datasets finds that human movements show no evidence of characteristic spatial scales. There, human mobility is described as scale free1--3. On the other hand, geographically, the concept of scale---referring to meaningful levels of description from individual buildings to neighbourhoods, cities, regions and countries---is central for the description of various aspects of human behaviour, such as socioeconomic interactions, or political and cultural dynamics4,5. Here we resolve this apparent paradox by showing that day-to-day human mobility does indeed contain meaningful scales, corresponding to spatial `containers' that restrict mobility behaviour. The scale-free results arise from aggregating displacements across containers. We present a simple model---which given a person's trajectory---infers their neighbourhood, city and so on, as well as the sizes of these geographical containers. We find that the containers---characterizing the trajectories of more than 700,000 individuals---do indeed have typical sizes. We show that our model is also able to~generate highly realistic trajectories and provides a way to understand the differences in mobility behaviour across countries, gender groups and urban--rural areas.},

  abstract = {Assessing smoke damage in cancer genomes We have known for over 60 years that smoking tobacco is one of the most avoidable risk factors for cancer. Yet the detailed mechanisms by which tobacco smoke damages the genome and creates the mutations that ultimately cause cancer are still not fully understood. Alexandrov et al. examined mutational signatures and DNA methylation changes in over 5000 genome sequences from 17 different cancer types linked to smoking (see the Perspective by Pfeifer). They found a complex pattern of mutational signatures. Only cancers originating in tissues directly exposed to smoke showed a signature characteristic of the known tobacco carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene. One mysterious signature was shared by all smoking-associated cancers but is of unknown origin. Smoking had only a modest effect on DNA methylation. Science, this issue p. 618; see also p. 549 Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of human cancer. We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types. Tobacco smoke causes cancer through mutational processes that are more complex than previously thought.

  abstract = {In ``Calvin and Hobbes,'' the character Calvin invents the game of Calvinball. No two games of Calvinball are alike because the only stable rule of Calvinball is that the players make up the rules as they go along, and no rule (other than the one stable rule) can be used twice. Whether a player is winning at a particular game of Calvinball is thus definitionally indeterminate. In philosophy, we risk playing something like Calvinball. It's often unclear what the rules are, whether there are rules, and who gets to make up the rules as we go along. Even in the more restricted domain of the history of philosophy---the focus of the current paper---it's often unclear what the rules are, whether there are rules, and who gets to make them up as we go along. Some interpreters of, for instance, Nietzsche, insist on sticking to the letter of the text. Others, most notoriously Heidegger and his followers, insist that what's most important about a philosopher like Nietzsche is not what he wrote but what he didn't write. Just like in Calvinball, because people play by different rules and make it up as they go along, it can be hard to tell who is winning an interpretive argument. This paper proposes that digital humanities offers a modest way forward for interpreters who don't want to play Calvinball. In particular, it is argued that digital humanities methods can be used (1) to set a default for the importance of various concepts, (2) to periodize a philosopher's works and track the increase or decline in importance of various concepts across a philosopher's career, and (3) to establish which conceptual connections should or should not be attributed to a philosopher. The value of this approach is demonstrated with a detailed investigation of Nietzsche on the functions of shame.},

This paper examines the heterogeneous nature of categories within the DSM-5, how this heterogeneity is expressed across diagnostic criteria, and its consequences for clinicians, clients, and the diagnostic model. Selected chapters of the DSM-5 were thematically analysed: schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar and related disorders; depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; and trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Themes identified heterogeneity in specific diagnostic criteria, including symptom comparators, duration of difficulties, indicators of severity, and perspective used to assess difficulties. Wider variations across diagnostic categories examined symptom overlap across categories, and the role of trauma. Pragmatic criteria and difficulties that recur across multiple diagnostic categories offer flexibility for the clinician, but undermine the model of discrete categories of disorder. This nevertheless has implications for the way cause is conceptualised, such as implying that trauma affects only a limited number of diagnoses despite increasing evidence to the contrary. Individual experiences and specific causal pathways within diagnostic categories may also be obscured. A pragmatic approach to psychiatric assessment, allowing for recognition of individual experience, may therefore be a more effective way of understanding distress than maintaining commitment to a disingenuous categorical system.},

However, links in networks only allow for pairwise interactions, thus making the framework suitable for dyadic games, but not for games that are played in larger groups. Here, we study the evolutionary dynamics of a public goods game in social systems with higher-order interactions. First, we show that the game on uniform hypergraphs corresponds to the replicator dynamics in the well-mixed limit, providing a formal theoretical foundation to study cooperation in networked groups. Second, we unveil how the presence of hubs and the coexistence of interactions in groups of different sizes affects the evolution of cooperation. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to extract the actual dependence of the synergy factor on the size of a group from real-world collaboration data in science and technology. Our work provides a way to implement informed actions to boost cooperation in social groups.},

We witnessed this during the COVID-19 pandemic, where misinformation undermined the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders, posing an additional obstacle in the fight against the virus. In this research, we study misinformation spreading, reanalyzing behavioral data on online sharing, and analyzing decision-making mechanisms using the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM). We find that subjects display an increased instinctive inclination towards sharing misleading news, but rational thinking significantly curbs this reaction, especially for more cautious and older individuals. Using an agent-based model, we expand this individual knowledge to a social network where individuals are exposed to misinformation through friends and share (or not) content with probabilities driven by DDM. The natural shape of the Twitter network provides a fertile ground for any news to rapidly become viral, yet we found that limiting users' followers proves to be an appropriate and feasible containment strategy.},

We utilize a corpus of 240,000 admissions essays submitted by 60,000 applicants to the University of California in November 2016 to measure the relationship between the content of application essays, reported household income, and standardized test scores (SAT) at scale. We quantify essay content using correlated topic modeling (CTM) and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software package. Results show that essays have a stronger correlation to reported household income than SAT scores. Essay content also explains much of the variance in SAT scores, suggesting that essays encode some of the same information as the SAT, though this relationship attenuates as household income increases. Efforts to realize more equitable college admissions protocols can be informed by attending to how social class is encoded in non-numerical components of applications.},

We have applied this classifier to over 20 million names from a large-scale news corpus, identifying interesting temporal and spatial trends on the representation of particular cultural/ethnic groups.},

Adopting the so-called `nation' metaphor in order to investigate relationships between disciplines, the framework uses an analogy with Dani Rodrik's `world political trilemma' (whereby democracy---here self-determination of science---national sovereignty---here disciplines---and global economic integration---here disciplinary integration---are mutually incompatible) to distinguish three different roads to the realisation of the unity of social science (`reductionism', `integration' and `complexity'). The framework is then applied to recent proposals for unifying the social sciences that have originated within the economics profession at a time of pervasive specialisation and increasing fragmentation. While discussing the origins, the feasibility and the desirability of disciplinary integration projects, we concentrate on the issue of pluralism in both social sciences and within economics and on the `structural' conditions that would permit economics to participate in the development of a transdisciplinary behavioural science.},

Recently, however, the need of adjustment for information theory-based measures has been argued because of the so-called selection bias problem, that is, they show the tendency in choosing clustering solutions with more communities. In this article, an experimental evaluation of these measures is performed to deeply investigate the problem, and an adjustment that scales the values of these measures is proposed. Experiments on synthetic networks, for which the ground-truth division is known, highlight that scaled NMI does not present the selection bias behavior. Moreover, a comparison among some well-known community detection methods on synthetic generated networks shows a fairer behavior of scaled NMI, especially when the network topology does not present a clear community structure. The experimentation also on two real-world networks reveals that the corrected formula allows to choose, among a set, the method finding a network division that better reflects the ground-truth structure.},

Next, we identify four distinct research epochs where the pattern of topical overlaps are stable and different from other eras: an early NLP period from 1980 to 1988, the period of US government-sponsored MUC and ATIS evaluations from 1989 to 1994, a transitory period until 2001, and a modern integration period from 2002 onwards. Third, we analyze the flow of authors across topics to discern how some subfields flow into the next, forming different stages of ACL research. We find that the government-sponsored bakeoffs brought new researchers to the field, and bridged early topics to modern probabilistic approaches. Last, we identify steep increases in author retention during the bakeoff era and the modern era, suggesting two points at which the field became more integrated.},

  abstract = {During speech processing, human listeners can separately analyze lexical and intonational cues to arrive at a unified representation of communicative content. The evolution of this capacity can be best investigated by comparative studies. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored whether and how dog brains segregate and integrate lexical and intonational information. We found a hemispheric bias for processing meaningful words, independently of intonation; an auditory brain region for distinguishing intonationally marked and unmarked words; and increased activity in primary reward regions only when both lexical and intonational information were consistent with praise. Neural mechanisms to separately analyze and integrate word meaning and intonation in dogs suggest that this capacity can evolve in the absence of language.},

A complex set of methods and macro-econometric models was applied on two balanced panels, compiled during 1995--2016, that bind random effects models with panel-corrected standard errors, spatial analysis and structural equation modelling. Overall, the importance of research, development, innovation and specific skills acquired in the field of bioeconomy is outlined, as key elements of E.U. economic strategies, being essential for all Member States.},

First, the truth values of logical propositions span a set of linguistic terms such as true, very true, almost false, very false, and false. Second, the logic allows logical categories to overlap in contrast to Boolean logic, where the two possible logical categories, "true" and "false," are sharply distinct. A game becomes a linguistic fuzzy logic game by turning strategies into linguistic fuzzy strategies, players' preferences into linguistic fuzzy preferences, and the rules of reasoning and inferences of the game into linguistic fuzzy reasoning operating according to linguistic fuzzy logic. This leads to the introduction of a new notion of linguistic fuzzy domination and linguistic Nash equilibrium.},

To determine whether the same is true of other visual displays, journals in seven disciplines were surveyed for their use of nongraph illustrations (NGIs) along with other inscriptions, both visual and nonvisual. Like graphs, NGIs were used more by the harder sciences. Among NGI types, photographs were used most in the biomedical fields and conceptual diagrams most in the soft sciences. Neither the use of tables nor the use of equations was systematically related to hardness, suggesting that the scientificity of disciplines may be more closely related to their visuality than to their mathematization. The uneven distribution of visual displays across the sciences is discussed in terms of their ease of comprehension, rhetorical power, and role in consensus formation.},

There are two core challenges, which should be addressed: 1) ensuring that scientific publications are credible -- e.g. that claims are not made without supporting evidence, and that all relevant supporting evidence is provided; and 2) that scientific findings are not misrepresented, distorted or outright misreported when communicated by journalists or the general public. I will present some first steps towards addressing these problems and outline remaining challenges.},

  abstract = {Genomics and domestication of wheat Modern wheat, which underlies the diet of many across the globe, has a long history of selection and crosses among different species. Avni et al. used the Hi-C method of genome confirmation capture to assemble and annotate the wild allotetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum). They then identified the putative causal mutations in genes controlling shattering (a key domestication trait among cereal crops). They also performed an exome capture--based analysis of domestication among wild and domesticated genotypes of emmer wheat. The findings present a compelling overview of the emmer wheat genome and its usefulness in an agricultural context for understanding traits in modern bread wheat. Science, this issue p. 93 Wheat (Triticum spp.) is one of the founder crops that likely drove the Neolithic transition to sedentary agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent more than 10,000 years ago. Identifying genetic modifications underlying wheat's domestication requires knowledge about the genome of its allo-tetraploid progenitor, wild emmer (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides). We report a 10.1-gigabase assembly of the 14 chromosomes of wild tetraploid wheat, as well as analyses of gene content, genome architecture, and genetic diversity. With this fully assembled polyploid wheat genome, we identified the causal mutations in Brittle Rachis 1 (TtBtr1) genes controlling shattering, a key domestication trait. A study of genomic diversity among wild and domesticated accessions revealed genomic regions bearing the signature of selection under domestication. This reference assembly will serve as a resource for accelerating the genome-assisted improvement of modern wheat varieties. A polyploid wheat genome assembly elucidates wheat domestication history.

  abstract = {Data analysis techniques from network science have fundamentally improved our understanding of neural systems and the complex behaviors that they support. Yet the restriction of network techniques to the study of pairwise interactions prevents us from taking into account intrinsic topological features such as cavities that may be crucial for system function. To detect and quantify these topological features, we must turn to algebro-topological methods that encode data as a simplicial complex built from sets of interacting nodes called simplices. We then use the relations between simplices to expose cavities within the complex, thereby summarizing its topological features. Here we provide an introduction to persistent homology, a fundamental method from applied topology that builds a global descriptor of system structure by chronicling the evolution of cavities as we move through a combinatorial object such as a weighted network. We detail the mathematics and perform demonstrative calculations on the mouse structural connectome, synapses in C. elegans, and genomic interaction data. Finally, we suggest avenues for future work and highlight new advances in mathematics ready for use in neural systems.},

The first part of this paper develops and justifies a Bayesian model of myside bias at the level of individual reasoning. In the second part, this Bayesian model is implemented in an agent-based model of group discussion among myside-biased agents. The agent-based model is then used to perform a number of experiments with the objective to study whether the myside bias hinders or enhances the ability of groups to collectively track the truth, that is, to reach the correct answer to a given binary issue. An analysis of the results suggests the following: First, whether the truth-tracking ability of groups is helped or hindered by myside bias crucially depends on how the strength of myside bias is differentially distributed across subgroups of discussants holding different beliefs. Second, small groups are more likely to track the truth than larger groups, suggesting that increasing group size has a detrimental effect on collective truth-tracking through discussion.},

  abstract = {Scientific datasets often have hierarchical structure: for example, in surveys, individual participants (samples) might be grouped at a higher level (units) such as their geographical region. In these settings, the interest is often in exploring the structure on the unit level rather than on the sample level. Units can be compared based on the distance between their means, however this ignores the within-unit distribution of samples. Here we develop an approach for exploratory analysis of hierarchical datasets using the Wasserstein distance metric that takes into account the shapes of within-unit distributions. We use t-SNE to construct 2D embeddings of the units, based on the matrix of pairwise Wasserstein distances between them. The distance matrix can be efficiently computed by approximating each unit with a Gaussian distribution, but we also provide a scalable method to compute exact Wasserstein distances. We use synthetic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our Wasserstein t-SNE, and apply it to data from the 2017 German parliamentary election, considering polling stations as samples and voting districts as units. The resulting embedding uncovers meaningful structure in the data.},

  abstract = {Dealing with uncertainty in applications of machine learning to real-life data critically depends on the knowledge of intrinsic dimensionality (ID). A number of methods have been suggested for the purpose of estimating ID, but no standard package to easily apply them one by one or all at once has been implemented in Python. This technical note introduces scikit-dimension, an open-source Python package for intrinsic dimension estimation. scikit-dimension package provides a uniform implementation of most of the known ID estimators based on scikit-learn application programming interface to evaluate global and local intrinsic dimension, as well as generators of synthetic toy and benchmark datasets widespread in the literature. The package is developed with tools assessing the code quality, coverage, unit testing and continuous integration. We briefly describe the package and demonstrate its use in a large-scale (more than 500 datasets) benchmarking of methods for ID estimation in real-life and synthetic data. The source code is available at https://github.com/j-bac/ scikit-dimension, the documentation is available at https://scikit-dimension.readthedocs.io/.},

Friendship and peer rejection were found to have unique implications for adaptive development. Lower levels of preadolescent peer rejection uniquely predicted overall life status adjustment, whereas friended preadolescents had higher levels of general self-worth in adulthood even after controlling for perceived competence in preadolescence. In contrast, peer rejection and the absence of friendship were both associated with psychopathological symptoms in adulthood, although neither was uniquely predictive of symptomatology.},

I argue that standard calls for interpretability that focus on the epistemic inscrutability of black-box machine learning may be misplaced. The problems of transparency and interpretability of machine learning stem from how we perceive the possibility of `machine knowledge'. In other words, the justification for machine knowledge does not need to include transparency and interpretability. Therefore, I am going to examine some sort of machine learning epistemology and provide three possible justifications for machine knowledge, which are formal justification, model justification and practical justification.},

In humans, information flows were initially shaped by natural selection yet are increasingly structured by emerging communication technologies. Our larger, more complex social networks now transfer high-fidelity information over vast distances at low cost. The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social systems, with poorly understood functional consequences. This gap in our knowledge represents a principal challenge to scientific progress, democracy, and actions to address global crises. We argue that the study of collective behavior must rise to a ``crisis discipline'' just as medicine, conservation, and climate science have, with a focus on providing actionable insight to policymakers and regulators for the stewardship of social systems.},

But why? He set off to find the answer on a fascinating and moving journey that took him into the lives of modern day slaves and along a supply chain that leads directly to the cell phones in our pockets. He found solutions that redeemed both the lives of the slaves in the world's most threatened places and the environments they live in.

Interpolation occurs for a sample x whenever this sample falls inside or on the boundary of the given dataset's convex hull. Extrapolation occurs when x falls outside of that convex hull. One fundamental (mis)conception is that state-of-the-art algorithms work so well because of their ability to correctly interpolate training data. A second (mis)conception is that interpolation happens throughout tasks and datasets, in fact, many intuitions and theories rely on that assumption. We empirically and theoretically argue against those two points and demonstrate that on any high-dimensional ({$>$}100) dataset, interpolation almost surely never happens. Those results challenge the validity of our current interpolation/extrapolation definition as an indicator of generalization performances.},

Recent evidence indicates that obesity and metabolic disease can also influence the immune system1--7, although the mechanisms and effects on immunotherapy outcomes remain largely unknown. Here, using two models of atopic dermatitis, we show that lean and obese mice mount markedly different immune responses. Obesity converted the classical type 2 T helper (TH2)-predominant disease associated with atopic dermatitis to a more severe disease with prominent TH17 inflammation.~We also observed divergent responses to biologic therapies targeting TH2 cytokines, which robustly protected lean mice but exacerbated disease in obese mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with genome-wide binding analyses revealed decreased activity of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-{$\gamma$} (PPAR{$\gamma$}) in TH2 cells from obese mice relative to lean mice. Conditional ablation of PPAR{$\gamma$} in T cells revealed that PPAR{$\gamma$} is required to focus the in vivo TH response towards a TH2-predominant state and prevent aberrant non-TH2 inflammation. Treatment of obese mice with a small-molecule PPAR{$\gamma$} agonist limited development of TH17 pathology and unlocked therapeutic responsiveness to targeted anti-TH2 biologic therapies. These studies reveal the effects of obesity on immunological disease and suggest a precision medicine approach to target the immune dysregulation caused by obesity.},

  abstract = {The structure of communication networks is an important determinant of the capacity of teams, organizations and societies to solve policy, business and science problems. Yet, previous studies reached contradictory results about the relationship between network structure and performance, finding support for the superiority of both well-connected efficient and poorly connected inefficient network structures. Here we argue that understanding how communication networks affect group performance requires taking into consideration the social learning strategies of individual team members. We show that efficient networks outperform inefficient networks when individuals rely on conformity by copying the most frequent solution among their contacts. However, inefficient networks are superior when individuals follow the best member by copying the group member with the highest payoff. In addition, groups relying on conformity based on a small sample of others excel at complex tasks, while groups following the best member achieve greatest performance for simple tasks. Our findings reconcile contradictory results in the literature and have broad implications for the study of social learning across disciplines.},

The primary motivation for this theory is the case that the theory adequately accounts for the genesis of scientific understanding. Standard models of explanation are, moreover, allegedly constructed on the basis of a misconception of the nature of understanding. My thesis is that the unificationist account of understanding proposed by Friedman and Kitcher is false, and hence, that the theory of explanatory unification is fundamentally misconceived.                            How does an explanation of some explanandum render the explanandum as `understood'? Carl Hempel wrote of the D-N covering law model that it shows that ``given the particular circumstances and the laws in question, the occurrence of the phenomenon               was to be expected;               and it is in this sense that the explanation allows us to               understand why               the phenomenon occurred.''},

It does this by making it less likely that past partial success will continue to reinforce suboptimal practice.

  abstract = {This paper interrogates influential contemporary accounts of interdisciplinarity, in which it is portrayed as offering new ways of rendering science accountable to society and/or of forging closer relations between scientific research and innovation. The basis of the paper is an eighteen-month empirical study of three interdisciplinary fields that cross the boundaries between the natural sciences or engineering, on the one hand, and the social sciences or arts, on the other. The fields are: 1) environmental and climate change research, 2) ethnography in the IT industry and 3) art-science. In the first part of the paper, in contrast to existing accounts, we question the idea that interdisciplinarity should be understood in terms of the synthesis of two or more disciplines. We stress the forms of agonism and antagonism that often characterize relations between disciplinary and interdisciplinary research, and distinguish between three modes of interdisciplinarity. In the second part we outline three distinctive logics or rationales that guide interdisciplinary research. In addition to the logics of accountability and innovation, we identify the logic of ontology, that is, an orientation apparent in diverse interdisciplinary practices in each of our three fields towards effecting ontological transformation in the objects and relations of research. While the three logics are interdependent, they are not reducible to each other and are differently entangled in each of the fields. We point to the potential for invention in such interdisciplinary practices and, against the equation of disciplinary research with autonomy, to the possibility of forms of interdisciplinary autonomy.},

People are convinced that they obey seemingly intuitive laws, while the underlying mathematical structure reveals a different and more complex reality. This article is a brief and rigorous journey through the implications that the mathematical laws governing stochastic processes have on gambling. It addresses a specific process, the random walk, and analyze some instances of fair and unfair games by highlighting the fallacy of many of our intuitions and beliefs. The paper gradually moves from the analysis of the random walk properties to a comprehensive description of the ruin problem. The introduction of the idea of transient and persistent states concludes the discussion. Much emphasis is placed on concrete examples and on the numerical values, in particular of the involved probabilities, and the interpretation of the results is always more central than the demonstrative technical details, which are nevertheless available to the reader.},

Life is defined as the instance of lyfe that we are familiar with on Earth, one that uses a specific organometallic molecular toolbox to record information about its environment and achieve dynamical order by dissipating certain planetary disequilibria. This new classification system allows the astrobiological community to more clearly define the questions that propel their research---e.g., whether they are developing a historical narrative to explain the origin of life (on Earth), or a universal narrative for the emergence of lyfe, or whether they are seeking signs of life specifically, or lyfe at large across the universe. While the concept of ``life as we don't know it'' is not new, the four pillars of lyfe offer a novel perspective on the living state that is indifferent to the particular components that might produce it.},

Yet its understanding in philosophical studies of science deserves renewed attention: Should philosophers think differently about the advancement of science when they deal with the uncertainty of outcome in ongoing research in comparison with historical episodes? This paper argues that normative appeals to empirical success in the evaluation of competing scientific explanations can result in unreliable conclusions, especially when we are looking at the changeability of direction in unsettled investigations. The challenges we encounter arise from the inherent dynamics of disciplinary and experimental objectives in research practice. In this paper we discuss how these dynamics inform the evaluation of empirical success by analyzing three of its requirements: data accommodation, instrumental reliability, and predictive power. We conclude that the assessment of empirical success in developing inquiry is set against the background of a model's interactive success and prospective value in an experimental context. Our argument is exemplified by the analysis of an apparent controversy surrounding the model of a quantum nose in research on olfaction. Notably, the public narrative of this controversy rests on a distorted perspective on measures of empirical success.},

This is graphically shown to be reasonable, but only above certain levels of migration for our data from mathematical reviews spanning 17 years (1959--1975). The inter-related structure of Mathematics is then mapped using migration data in the appropriate range. We find the resulting map to be a good reflection of the disciplinary variation in the field of Mathematics.},

Fortunately they are sparse and can be still processed relatively fast. We answer the question when the multiplication of sparse networks preserves sparseness. The proposed approaches are illustrated with analyses of collection of networks on the topic ``social network'' obtained from the Web of Science. The works with large number of co-authors add large complete subgraphs to standard collaboration network thus bluring the collaboration structure. We show that using an appropriate normalization their effect can be neutralized.

  abstract = {Many real-world complex systems consist of a set of elementary units connected by relationships of different kinds. All such systems are better described in terms of multiplex networks, where the links at each layer represent a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes, rather than in terms of (single-layer) networks. In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of: i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers. The measures we introduce are validated on a genuine multiplex data set of Indonesian terrorists, where information among 78 individuals are recorded with respect to mutual trust, common operations, exchanged communications and business relationships.},

I begin with a brief review of the databases that have been developed for data involving, for example, protein-protein interactions, that are relational and hence productively represented in networks. Given the amount of data stored in modern databases, raw network representations are typically hairballs that provides researchers little useful information other than that lots of things interact. Cytoscape was created by systems biologists to facilitate moving beyond hairballs to informative representations. It provides tools for clustering nodes and annotating them according to what is known about the objects represented. I provide examples of how Cytoscape has been deployed to develop new knowledge about biological mechanisms. Cytoscape has been made freely available, and I describe how a large interational community of researchers has created Apps that enable researchers to make a number of more specialized inferences. NDEx, created by members of the same research lab, serves as an Expo for networks---researchers can share networks they have developed and other researchers can search for networks and made them the basis for further incorporation of data or analyses.},

  abstract = {We consider computational modeling in two fields: chronobiology and cognitive science. In circadian rhythm models, variables generally correspond to properties of parts and operations of the responsible mechanism. A computational model of this complex mechanism is grounded in empirical discoveries and contributes a more refined understanding of the dynamics of its behavior. In cognitive science, on the other hand, computational modelers typically advance de novo proposals for mechanisms to account for behavior. They offer indirect evidence that a proposed mechanism is adequate to produce particular behavioral data, but typically there is no direct empirical evidence for the hypothesized parts and operations. Models in these two fields differ in the extent of their empirical grounding, but they share the goal of achieving dynamic mechanistic explanation. That is, they augment a proposed mechanistic explanation with a computational model that enables exploration of the mechanism's dynamics. Using exemplars from circadian rhythm research, we extract six specific contributions provided by computational models. We then examine cognitive science models to determine how well they make the same types of contributions. We suggest that the modeling approach used in circadian research may prove useful in cognitive science as researchers develop procedures for experimentally decomposing cognitive mechanisms into parts and operations and begin to understand their nonlinear interactions.},

  abstract = {Explaining the complex dynamics exhibited in many biological mechanisms requires extending the recent philosophical treatment of mechanisms that emphasizes sequences of operations. To understand how nonsequentially organized mechanisms will behave, scientists often advance what we call dynamic mechanistic explanations. These begin with a decomposition of the mechanism into component parts and operations, using a variety of laboratory-based strategies. Crucially, the mechanism is then recomposed by means of computational models in which variables or terms in differential equations correspond to properties of its parts and operations. We provide two illustrations drawn from research on circadian rhythms. Once biologists identified some of the components of the molecular mechanism thought to be responsible for circadian rhythms, computational models were used to determine whether the proposed mechanisms could generate sustained oscillations. Modeling has become even more important as researchers have recognized that the oscillations generated in individual neurons are synchronized within networks; we describe models being employed to assess how different possible network architectures could produce the observed synchronized activity.},

This claim is quite popular in the literature. The aim of this paper is to argue against the claim and to develop an alternative explanation of why computer simulations resemble experiments. To this purpose, experiment is characterized in terms of an intervention on a system and of the observation of the reaction. Thus, if computer simulations are experiments, either the computer hardware or the target system must be intervened on and observed. I argue against the first option using the non-observation argument, among others. The second option is excluded by e.g. the over-control argument, which stresses epistemological differences between experiments and simulations. To account for the similarities between experiments and computer simulations, I propose to say that computer simulations can model possible experiments and do in fact often do so.},

In this work, we consider the specialized task of mathematical expression recognition, which is characterized by a highly structured format and strict syntax rules, where the slightest mistake can lead to a very different meaning of the formula. To tackle this problem, we present a neural architecture based on a convolutional neural network focused specifically on fine-grained structures in the image. The obtained visual representations are used as an input to an encoder and an attention-based decoder module, trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Given an input image, our model generates the underlying LaTeX markup that is able to perfectly describe the target mathematical formula.

  abstract = {Understanding the rise, spread, and fall of large-scale states in the ancient world has occupied thinkers for millennia. However, no comprehensive mechanistic model of state dynamics based on their insights has emerged, leaving it difficult to evaluate empirically or quantitatively the different explanations offered. Here I present a spatially- and temporallyresolved agent-based model incorporating several hypotheses about the behavior of largescale ({$>$}200 thousand km2) agrarian states and steppe nomadic confederations in Afro-Eurasia between the late Bronze and the end of the Medieval era (1500 BCE to 1500 CE). The model tracks the spread of agrarian states as they expand, conquer the territory of other states or are themselves conquered, and, occasionally, collapse. To accurately retrodict the historical record, several key contingent regional technological advances in state military and agricultural efficiencies are identified. Modifying the location, scale, and timing of these contingent developments allows quantitative investigation of historically-plausible alternative trajectories of state growth, spread, and fragmentation, while demonstrating the operation and limits of the model. Under nominal assumptions, the rapid yet staggered increase of agrarian state sizes across Eurasia after 600 BCE occurs in response to intense military pressure from `mirror` steppe nomadic confederations. Nevertheless, in spite of various technological advances throughout the period, the modeled creation and spread of new agrarian states is a fundamental consequence of state collapse and internal civil wars triggered by rising `demographic-structural' pressures that occur when state territorial growth is checked yet (warrior elite) population growth continues. Together the model's underlying mechanisms substantially account for the number of states, their duration, location, spread rate, overall occupied area, and total population size for three thousand years.},

  abstract = {The introduction of RNA velocity in single cells has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation. The originally proposed framework obtains velocities as the deviation of the observed ratio of spliced and unspliced mRNA from an inferred steady state. Errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. With scVelo (https://scvelo.org), we address these restrictions by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to a wide variety of systems comprising transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, and recover the latent time of the underlying cellular processes. This latent time represents the cell's internal clock and is based only on its transcriptional dynamics. Moreover, scVelo allows us to identify regimes of regulatory changes such as stages of cell fate commitment and, therein, systematically detects putative driver genes. We demonstrate that scVelo enables disentangling heterogeneous subpopulation kinetics with unprecedented resolution in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We anticipate that scVelo will greatly facilitate the study of lineage decisions, gene regulation, and pathway activity identification.},

These relationships hold controlling for dozens of other factors (e.g. SAT score, parents' education, and essay content), suggesting that essay topography encodes information that goes beyond family background. Overall, this work sheds light on how language reflects thought, demonstrates that how people express themselves can provide insight into their future success, and provides a systematic, scalable, and objective method for quantifying the topography of thought.},

However, we know much less about how influence works among relative strangers in digital public squares, despite important conversations happening in such spaces. We present the results of a study on large public Facebook pages where we randomly used two different methods--most recent and social feedback--to order comments on posts. We find that the social feedback condition results in higher quality viewed comments and response comments. After measuring the average quality of comments written by users before the study, we find that social feedback has a positive effect on response quality for both low and high quality commenters. We draw on a theoretical framework of social norms to explain this empirical result. In order to examine the influence mechanism further, we measure the similarity between comments viewed and written during the study, finding that similarity increases for the highest quality contributors under the social feedback condition. This suggests that, in addition to norms, some individuals may respond with increased relevance to high-quality comments.},

Given its ability to formalize systems-level models, network neuroscience has generated unique explanations of neural function and behavior. The mechanistic status of these explanations and how they can contribute to and fit within the field of neuroscience as a whole has received careful treatment from philosophers. However, these philosophical contributions have not yet reached many neuroscientists. Here we complement formal philosophical efforts by providing an applied perspective from and for neuroscientists. We discuss the mechanistic status of the explanations offered by network neuroscience and how they contribute to, enhance, and interdigitate with other types of explanations in neuroscience. In doing so, we rely on philosophical work concerning the role of causality, scale, and mechanisms in scientific explanations. In particular, we make the distinction between an explanation and the evidence supporting that explanation, and we argue for a scale-free nature of mechanistic explanations. In the course of these discussions, we hope to provide a useful applied framework in which network neuroscience explanations can be exercised across scales and combined with other fields of neuroscience to gain deeper insights into the brain and behavior.},

No proposed form for the statistical distribution of city sizes has received more attention than Zipf's law, a Pareto distribution with power law exponent equal to one. However, this distribution is typically violated by empirical evidence for small and large cities. Moreover, no theory presently exists to derive city size distributions from fundamental demographic choices while also explaining consistent variations. Here we develop a comprehensive framework based on demography to show how the structure of migration flows between cities, together with the differential magnitude of their vital rates, determine a variety of city size distributions. This approach provides a powerful mathematical methodology for deriving Zipf's law as well as other size distributions under specific conditions, and to resolve puzzles associated with their deviations in terms of concepts of choice, symmetry, information, and selection.},

  abstract = {With the advent of VLSI, complex circuits can be implemented on a small single chip leading to the development of embedded devices that perform dedicated functions most commonly deployed as Cyber Physical System (CPS) today. Security of real-time cyber physical systems is of great concern these days as attacking a single device in a network may cause all the devices in the network to be affected and the result of attack may be severe as these devices may need to respond in real time. Most of the CPS are built with USB ports which are extensively used for connectivity. It is possible for a proximate attacker to exploit the vulnerabilities in the devices through USB ports. Since merely powering-on a system and connecting a USB device provides it with access to kernel, the security of the device is at stake. For the real time cyber physical systems providing critical functionality, even a typical reboot may be of concern depending on its functionality. Hence these devices are to be thoroughly tested against any vulnerabilities and necessary measures are taken at initial stages of development. This paper covers experiences with fuzzing implemented using both Facedancer21 and umap tool and exploiting the driver vulnerability with invalid endpoint number using Facedancer21. The drivers that are vulnerable were disabled in the target host and the experiment was repeated and the target was found to be resistant to the attacks as the drivers responsible for the system crash were not loading during the enumeration process, thus securing the USB ports.},

However, studying the conversations of chatbots for  emergent rationales can provide valuable insights into their apparent sensibilities, capabilities of using complex logic, and offer glimpses into potential future possibilities. An effective approach for such analysis would be to enter into dialogues with a chatbot using literary works and fictional narratives. In our study, we utilize stories from Arthur Ryder's book Twenty-Two Goblins to present moral and ethical dilemmas to ChatGPT. This book, based on an ancient Sanskrit frame story called Vetala Tales, features a mischievous spirit narrating stories to a king who must answer a question at the end of each tale. We employ a similar method by presenting these stories to ChatGPT and posing similar questions. Using an exploratory approach we compare the reasoning structures. Whereas the king's answers seem to have strong sociocultural underpinnings, the AI's decisions are mostly contextual and predominantly rely on the intensity of actions performed by the characters in the stories. The AI demonstrates the ability to reasonably interpret the emotions of the characters, but it does not exhibit higher-order mentalization within its reasoning process. The qualitative insights from this study should be relevant for benchmarking an artificial intelligence's ability to uphold moral standards and encourage ethical behaviour.},

Differences in word meaning that depends on time, location, topic, and other factors, can be studied by analyzing embeddings generated from different corpora in collections that are representative of these factors. For example, language evolution can be studied using a collection of news articles published in different time periods. In this paper, we present a general framework to support cross-corpora language studies with word embeddings, where embeddings generated from different corpora can be compared to find correspondences and differences in meaning across the corpora. Compass Aligned Distributional Embeddings (CADE) is the core component of our framework and solves the key problem of aligning the embeddings generated from different corpora. In particular, we focus on providing solid evidence about the effectiveness, generality, and robustness of CADE. To this end, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments in different domains, from temporal word embeddings to language localization and topical analysis. The results of our experiments suggest that CADE achieves state-of-the-art or superior performance on tasks where several competing approaches are available, yet providing a general method that can be used in a variety of domains. Finally, our experiments shed light on the conditions under which the alignment is reliable, which substantially depends on the degree of cross-corpora vocabulary overlap.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread interest in narcissism, relatively little is known about the conditions that encourage or dampen it. Drawing on research showing that macroenvironmental conditions in emerging adulthood can leave a lasting imprint on attitudes and behaviors, I argue that people who enter adulthood during recessions are less likely to be narcissistic later in life than those who come of age in more prosperous times. Using large samples of American adults, Studies 1 and 2 showed that people who entered adulthood during worse economic times endorsed fewer narcissistic items as older adults. Study 3 extended these findings to a behavioral manifestation of narcissism: the relative pay of CEOs. CEOs who came of age in worse economic times paid themselves less relative to other top executives in their firms. These findings suggest that macroenvironmental experiences at a critical life stage can have lasting implications for how unique, special, and deserving people believe themselves to be.},

However, the resulting word groups are often not coherent, making them harder to interpret. Recently, neural topic models have shown improvements in overall coherence. Concurrently, contextual embeddings have advanced the state of the art of neural models in general. In this paper, we combine contextualized representations with neural topic models. We find that our approach produces more meaningful and coherent topics than traditional bag-of-words topic models and recent neural models. Our results indicate that future improvements in language models will translate into better topic models.},

The goal was to assess how likely Austrian ICUs would become overburdened with COVID-19 patients in the upcoming weeks. We consolidated the output of three independent epidemiological models (ranging from agent-based micro simulation to parsimonious compartmental models) and published weekly short-term forecasts for the number of confirmed cases as well as estimates and upper bounds for the required hospital beds. Here, we report on three key contributions by which our forecasting and reporting system has helped shaping Austria's policy to navigate the crisis, namely (i) when and where case numbers and bed occupancy are expected to peak during multiple waves, (ii) whether to ease or strengthen non-pharmaceutical intervention in response to changing incidences, and (iii) how to provide hospital managers guidance to plan health-care capacities. Complex mathematical epidemiological models play an important role in guiding governmental responses during pandemic crises, in particular when they are used as a monitoring system to detect epidemiological change points.},

  abstract = {Although it is widely acknowledged that chess is the best example of an intellectual activity among games, evidence showing the association between any kind of intellectual ability and chess skill has been remarkably sparse. One of the reasons is that most of the studies investigated only one factor (e.g., intelligence), neglecting other factors relevant for the acquisition of chess skill (e.g., amount of practice, years of experience). The present study investigated the chess skill of 57 young chess players using measures of intelligence (WISC III), practice, and experience. Although practice had the most influence on chess skill, intelligence explained some variance even after the inclusion of practice. When an elite subsample of 23 children was tested, it turned out that intelligence was not a significant factor in chess skill, and that, if anything, it tended to correlate negatively with chess skill. This unexpected result is explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample. The study demonstrates the dangers of focusing on a single factor in complex real-world situations where a number of closely interconnected factors operate.},

On the other, Machine Learning (ML) systems that claim to predict human behaviour are becoming ubiquitous in all spheres of social life. I contend that ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML systems are close descendants of the Cartesian and Newtonian worldview in so far as they are tools that fundamentally sort, categorize, and classify the world, and forecast the future. Through the practice of clustering, sorting, and predicting human behaviour and action, these systems impose order, equilibrium, and stability to the active, fluid, messy, and unpredictable nature of human behaviour and the social world at large. Grounded in complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches, this article emphasizes why people, embedded in social systems, are indeterminable and unpredictable. When ML systems ``pick up'' patterns and clusters, this often amounts to identifying historically and socially held norms, conventions, and stereotypes. Machine prediction of social behaviour, I argue, is not only erroneous but also presents real harm to those at the margins of society.},

In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document.

Using the level of the mammillary bodies as an antomical landmark, the whole hippocampus-amygdala complex was divided into an anterior section (mainly containing amygdaloid tissue) and a posterior section (mainly containing the hippocampal formation). Total mesiotemporal tissue volume was reduced significantly in the patient group compared to controls (-11\%), with significant reductions in both left (-20\%) and right (-15\%) hippocampal sections. Reduced limbic tissue volume was associated with increased severity of psychopathology. Severity of positive psychotic symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] psychosis factor) was correlated significantly with right and left total mesiotemporal volumes (Spearman rho's = -0.61 p {$<$} 0.01). Negative symptom scores (BPRS anergia factor, Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms [SANS] global items) were not significantly correlated with any mesiotemporal tissue volumes. The data corroborate and extend previous findings of temporolimbic structure volume reduction in schizophrenia, and suggest that the positive psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with anatomic anomalies in mesiotemporal structure.},

Although the field today is synonymous with mathematical biology, when it first emerged it had a far more philosophical agenda. Regrettably, this early period of theoretical biology has been almost completely forgotten and its existence is seldom acknowledged---let alone carefully examined. Our aim is to rescue this multilingual corpus of monographs, book series and journal articles from the dustbin of history. Our guiding question is: What did theoretical biology look like in the early 20th century? We utilize LDA topic modelling (after machine translating where necessary), top2vec and document embeddings to create an interactive tool for the exploration of this corpus, which allows analyzing the development of early theoretical biology. Moreover, we calculate mathematization scores for the documents in our corpus to map the field's increasing emphasis on formal modeling. Ein Beitrag zur 8.

  abstract = {Neighbor embeddings are a family of methods for visualizing complex highdimensional datasets using kNN graphs. To find the low-dimensional embedding, these algorithms combine an attractive force between neighboring pairs of points with a repulsive force between all points. One of the most popular examples of such algorithms is t-SNE. Here we show that changing the balance between the attractive and the repulsive forces in t-SNE yields a spectrum of embeddings, which is characterized by a simple trade-off: stronger attraction can better represent continuous manifold structures, while stronger repulsion can better represent discrete cluster structures. We show that UMAP embeddings correspond to t-SNE with increased attraction; this happens because the negative sampling optimisation strategy employed by UMAP strongly lowers the effective repulsion. Likewise, ForceAtlas2, commonly used for visualizing developmental single-cell transcriptomic data, yields embeddings corresponding to t-SNE with the attraction increased even more. At the extreme of this spectrum lies Laplacian Eigenmaps, corresponding to zero repulsion. Our results demonstrate that many prominent neighbor embedding algorithms can be placed onto this attraction-repulsion spectrum, and highlight the inherent trade-offs between them.},

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character \$n\$-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character \$n\$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

Here, we extend this proposal by exploring how that negotiation might take place in practice. The working stock of historical examples that philosophers tend to employ has long been established informally, and, as a result, somewhat haphazardly. The composition of the historical canon of philosophy of science is therefore path dependent, and cases often become stock examples for reasons tangential to their appropriateness for the purposes at hand. We show how the lack of rigor around the canonization of case studies has muddied the waters in selected philosophical debates. This, in turn, lays the groundwork for proposing ways in which they can be improved.},

  abstract = {The rise of civilizations involved the dual emergence of economies that could produce surplus (``prosperity'') and states that could protect surplus (``security''). But the joint achievement of security and prosperity had to escape a paradox: prosperity attracts predation, and higher insecurity discourages the investments that create prosperity. We study the trade-offs facing a proto-state on its path to civilization through a formal model informed by the anthropological and historical literatures on the origin of civilizations. We emphasize pre-institutional forces, such as physical aspects of the geographical environment, that shape productive and defense capabilities. The solution of the civilizational paradox relies on high defense capabilities, natural or manmade. We show that higher initial productivity and investments that yield prosperity exacerbate conflict when defense capability is fixed, but may allow for security and prosperity when defense capability is endogenous. Some economic shocks and military innovations deliver security and prosperity while others force societies back into a trap of conflict and stagnation. We illustrate the model by analyzing the rise of civilization in Sumeria and Egypt, the first two historical cases, and the civilizational collapse at the end of the Bronze Age.},

It is shown that, despite its simplicity, this model can give rise to a variety of responses, either oscillatory or aperiodic, such as those envisaged by A. Toynbee. Since modern civilisations are characterised by fast parameter variations, their description calls instead for a time-variant model. Simulations with the linear parameter-varying model obtained from the aforementioned LTI model by letting its parameter vary are carried out to show the influence of different scenarios on the system response. Even if this model is elementary, it is believed that it may serve as a stimulating "tool for thought" in the ever-popular debate on the growth and decline of civilisations.},

  abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly used in the management sciences. Though useful, ABMs are often critiqued: it is hard to discern why they produce the results they do and whether other assumptions would yield similar results. To help researchers address such critiques, we propose a systematic approach to conducting sensitivity analyses of ABMs. Our approach deals with a feature that can complicate sensitivity analyses: most ABMs include important non-parametric elements, while most sensitivity analysis methods are designed for parametric elements only. The approach moves from charting out the elements of an ABM through identifying the goal of the sensitivity analysis to specifying a method for the analysis. We focus on four common goals of sensitivity analysis: determining whether results are robust, which elements have the greatest impact on outcomes, how elements interact to shape outcomes, and which direction outcomes move when elements change. For the first three goals, we suggest a combination of randomized finite change indices calculation through a factorial design. For direction of change, we propose a modification of individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots to account for the stochastic nature of the ABM response. We illustrate our approach using the Garbage Can Model, a classic ABM that examines how organizations make decisions.},

Furthermore, the data were analyzed with an advanced statistical technique---segmented regression analysis---which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (a) the number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (b) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three essential growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1\% up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3\% up to the period between the two world wars, and 8 to 9\% to 2010.},

It sank intoan almost complete oblivion during the twentieth, when it was eclipsedby neopositivism. However, Comte's decision to developsuccessively a philosophy of mathematics, a philosophy of physics, aphilosophy of chemistry and a philosophy of biology, makes him thefirst philosopher of science in the modern sense, and his constantattention to the social dimension of science resonates in manyrespects with current points of view. His political philosophy, on theother hand, is even less known, because it differs substantially fromthe classical political philosophy we have inherited., Comte's most important works are (1) the Course on PositivePhilosophy (1830--1842, six volumes, translated andcondensed by Harriet Martineau as The Positive Philosophy ofAuguste Comte); (2) the System of Positive Polity, orTreatise on Sociology, Instituting the Religion of Humanity,(1851--1854, four volumes); and (3) the Early Writings(1820--1829), where one can see the influence of Saint-Simon, forwhom Comte served as secretary from 1817 to 1824. The EarlyWritings are still the best introduction to Comte'sthought. In the Course, Comte said, science was transformedinto philosophy; in the System, philosophy was transformedinto religion. The second transformation met with strong opposition;as a result, it has become customary to distinguish, with Mill,between a ``good Comte'' (the author of the Course)and a ``bad Comte'' (the author of the System).Today's common conception of positivism corresponds mainly towhat can be found in the Course.},

  abstract = {Millions of people worldwide suffer from diseases that lead to paralysis through disruption of signal pathways between the brain and the muscles. Neuroprosthetic devices are designed to restore lost function and could be used to form an electronic `neural bypass' to circumvent disconnected pathways in the nervous system. It has previously been shown that intracortically recorded signals can be decoded to extract information related to motion, allowing non-human primates and paralysed humans to control computers and robotic arms through imagined movements. In non-human primates, these types of signal have also been used to drive activation of chemically paralysed arm muscles. Here we show that intracortically recorded signals can be linked in real-time to muscle activation to restore movement in a paralysed human. We used a chronically implanted intracortical microelectrode array to record multiunit activity from the motor cortex in a study participant with quadriplegia from cervical spinal cord injury. We applied machine-learning algorithms to decode the neuronal activity and control activation of the participant's forearm muscles through a custom-built high-resolution neuromuscular electrical stimulation system. The system provided isolated finger movements and the participant achieved continuous cortical control of six different wrist and hand motions. Furthermore, he was able to use the system to complete functional tasks relevant to daily living. Clinical assessment showed that, when using the system, his motor impairment improved from the fifth to the sixth cervical (C5--C6) to the seventh cervical to first thoracic (C7--T1) level unilaterally, conferring on him the critical abilities to grasp, manipulate, and release objects. This is the first demonstration to our knowledge of successful control of muscle activation using intracortically recorded signals in a paralysed human. These results have significant implications in advancing neuroprosthetic technology for people worldwide living with the effects of paralysis.},

An important task in such systems is to extract a simplified view of their time-dependent network of interactions. Community detection in temporal networks usually relies on aggregation over time windows or consider sequences of different stationary epochs. For dynamics-based methods, attempts to generalize static-network methodologies also face the fundamental difficulty that a stationary state of the dynamics does not always exist. Here, we derive a method based on a dynamical process evolving on the temporal network. Our method allows dynamics that do not reach a steady state and uncovers two sets of communities for a given time interval that accounts for the ordering of edges in forward and backward time. We show that our method provides a natural way to disentangle the different dynamical scales present in a system with synthetic and real-world examples.},

Three different accuracy measures are employed, one based on references in authoritative documents, one using textual relatedness and the last using document pairs linked by grants. We find that a hybrid relatedness measure based equally on direct citation and PubMed related article scores gives more accurate clusters (in the aggregate) than the other relatedness measures tested. We also show that the differences in cluster contents between the different models are even larger than the differences in accuracy, suggesting that the textual and citation logics are complementary. Finally, we show that for the hybrid based on direct citation and related article scores the larger clusters are more oriented toward textual relatedness while the smaller clusters are more oriented toward citation-based relatedness.},

In this study we compare two direct citation maps of a 16-year set of Scopus documents -- one that includes only source documents, and one that includes non-source documents along with the source documents. In addition to more than doubling the contents of the map, from 19M to 43M documents, the inclusion of non-source items strongly augments the social sciences relative to the natural sciences and medicine and makes their position in the map more central. Books are also found to play a significant role in the map, and are much more highly cited on average than articles.},

I argue that Humphreys's concepts are not able to analyse fully successfully a case of contemporary simulation in physics, which is more complex than the examples considered so far in the philosophical literature. I therefore modify Humphreys's definition of simulation. I allow for several successive layers of computational models, and I discuss the relations that exist between these models, the computer, and the object under study. An aim of my proposal is to clarify the distinction between computational models and numerical methods, and to better understand the representational and the computational functions of models in simulations.},

Controversies and confusions that often derive from this phenomenon will be illustrated in the context of econophysics and phylogeographic linguistics. Migration can be usefully contrasted with the concept of `imperialism', which has been influentially discussed in the context of geographical economics. In particular, imperialism, unlike migration, relies upon extension of the original model via an expansion of the domain of phenomena it is taken to adequately describe. The success of imperialism thus requires expansion of the justificatory sanctioning of the original idealising assumptions to a new disciplinary context. Contrastingly, successful migration involves the radical representational re-interpretation of the original model, rather than its extension. Migration thus requires `re-sanctioning' of new `counterpart idealisations' to allow application to an entirely different class of phenomena. Whereas legitimate scientific imperialism should be based on the pursuit of some form of ontological unification, no such requirement is needed to legitimate the practice of model migration. The distinction between migration and imperialism will thus be shown to have significant normative as well as descriptive value.},

Natural sciences: the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, physical, chemical, and biological factors of the universe). Natural science can be divided into two main branches: physical science and life science (or biological science). Social sciences: the study of human behavior and societies.Natural and social sciences are empirical sciences, meaning that the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions. This verifiability may well vary even within a scientific disciplineNatural, social, and formal science make up the fundamental sciences, which form the basis of interdisciplinary and applied sciences such as engineering and medicine. Specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminologies and expertises.},

These assumptions are too limited in scenarios where complex shapes, strong skews or multiple modes are present. In this paper, we propose a generic deep learning framework that learns an Uncountable Mixture of Asymmetric Laplacians (UMAL), which will allow us to estimate heterogeneous distributions of the output variable and shows its connections to quantile regression. Despite having a fixed number of parameters, the model can be interpreted as an infinite mixture of components, which yields a flexible approximation for heterogeneous distributions. Apart from synthetic cases, we apply this model to room price forecasting and to predict financial operations in personal bank accounts. We demonstrate that UMAL produces proper distributions, which allows us to extract richer insights and to sharpen decision-making.},

  abstract = {Fertility, or childbearing, expectations have been increasingly identified as an important area of research, at least in part because expectations may help us to understand family issues of concern across the globe such as unintended pregnancies, low fertility, and delayed childbearing. While much research has focused on the link between expectations and behavior, this study extends the literature by asking how those expectations were shaped initially. Specifically, we explore how one's economic context is related to expectations. This paper further extends the literature by focusing on two dimensions of the parenthood expectations of young people (men and women aged 18--27). Using the 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011 waves of the Panel Studies of Income Dynamics (PSID) Transition to Adulthood (TA) sample, we considered whether young people expected to have children in the future and, for those who did, when they expected to do so. The results support financial-strain theories of the relationship between (subjective and objective) economic circumstances and childbearing expectations. Women and men with lower earnings, less education, and more worries about their future job prospects are more uncertain whether they will have children. Of those who expect to have children, those with more education and more worries expect to do so later in life. Further analyses reveal that race and gender condition these relationships.},

The underlying common assumption is that only the best scientists manage to publish in a highly selective tier of the most prestigious journals. However, data from several lines of evidence suggest that the methodological quality of scientific experiments does not increase with increasing rank of the journal. On the contrary, an accumulating body of evidence suggests the inverse: methodological quality and, consequently, reliability of published research works in several fields may be decreasing with increasing journal rank. The data supporting these conclusions circumvent confounding factors such as increased readership and scrutiny for these journals, focussing instead on quantifiable indicators of methodological soundness in the published literature, relying on, in part, semi-automated data extraction from often thousands of publications at a time. With the accumulating evidence over the last decade grew the realization that the very existence of scholarly journals, due to their inherent hierarchy, constitutes one of the major threats to publicly funded science: hiring, promoting and funding scientists who publish unreliable science eventually erodes public trust in science.},

In contrast to the idea that fields studying lower level phenomena are always more fundamental in explanations, I argue that the particular combination of disciplines and theoretical approaches needed to address a complex biological problem and which among them is explanatorily more fundamental varies with the problem pursued. Solving a complex problem need not require theoretical unification or the stable synthesis of different biological fields, as items of knowledge from traditional disciplines can be related solely for the purposes of a specific problem. Apart from the development of genuine interfield theories, successful integration can be effected by smaller epistemic units (concepts, methods, explanations) being linked. Unification or integration is not an aim in itself, but needed for the aim of solving a particular scientific problem, where the problem's nature determines the kind of intellectual integration required.},

The causal effect of education on IQ at later ages is often difficult to uncover because analyses based on observational data are plagued by problems of reverse causation and self-selection into further education. We exploit a reform that increased compulsory schooling from 7 to 9 y in Norway in the 1960s to estimate the effect of education on IQ. We find that this schooling reform, which primarily affected education in the middle teenage years, had a substantial effect on IQ scores measured at the age of 19 y.},

The author then offers a description of method, highlighting the difficulty of identifying the work that might be considered ``comparative tax law.'' Next, the author conceptualizes and clusters contributions from scholars who have framed the comparative tax law field. The author argues that our national boundedness, combined with the lack of an explicit network of scholars, has masked the rich intellectual history in the field of comparative tax law. Finally, the author concludes by drawing attention to the network effects that seem to inform some of the approaches taken by the key contributors to comparative tax law's intellectual history.},

Several theories have been posited to account for the nature of asexuality. The goal of this review was to consider the evidence for whether asexuality is best classified as a psychiatric syndrome (or a symptom of one), a sexual dysfunction, or a paraphilia. Based on the available science, we believe there is not sufficient evidence to support the categorization of asexuality as a psychiatric condition (or symptom of one) or as a disorder of sexual desire. There is some evidence that a subset of self-identified asexuals have a paraphilia. We also considered evidence supportingtheclassification ofasexuality asauniquesexual orientation. We conclude that asexuality is a heterogeneous entity that likely meets conditions for a sexual orientation, and that researchers should further explore evidence for such a categorization.},

Chock full of useful advice and tables that outline the procedures, the text shows readers how to conduct exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and understand similarities to and differences from CFA; formulate, program, and interpret CFA models using popular latent variable software packages such as LISREL, Mplus, Amos, EQS, and SAS/CALIS; and report results from a CFA study. Also covered are extensions of CFA to traditional IRT analysis, methods for determining necessary sample sizes, and new CFA modeling possibilities, including multilevel factor models and factor mixture models. Special features include a Web page offering data and program syntax files for many of the research examples so that readers can practice the procedures described in the book with real data. The Web page also includes links to additional CFA-related resources.},

How will the work for the collaborative project be split? In this paper, we consider the following question in particular. Are there ways in which these divisions systematically disadvantage certain groups? We use evolutionary game theoretic models to address this question. First, we discuss results from O'Connor and Bruner (2015) showing that underrepresented groups in academia can be disadvantaged in collaboration and bargaining by dint of their small numbers. Second, we present novel results exploring how the hierarchical structure of academia can lead to bargaining disadvantage. We investigate models where one actor has a higher baseline of academic success, less to lose if collaboration goes south, or greater rewards for non-collaborative work. We show that in these situations, the less powerful partner can be disadvantaged in bargaining over collaboration.},

The article lists and explains five objections to the methods and methodology of the report.

Although that metaphysics has been repudiated in current philosophy of mind and cognitive science, the dichotomy still haunts these fields. As such, action is understood as distinct from movement, or motion. In early China, under a very different metaphysical paradigm, no such distinction is made. Instead, a notion of self-caused movement, or spontaneity, is elaborated. In this article a general conception of spontaneity from early Daoism is explained, detailing its constituent aspects. Similar notions appeared from time to time in Western philosophy, and these instances are pursued, exploring how their instantiations differed from Daoist spontaneity and why. Based on these approximate examples of spontaneity and on early Daoist spontaneity, new criteria are postulated for a plausible theory of action that dispenses with presuppositions that eventuate in a freedom/determinism dichotomy, and instead the possibility is offered of a general model of action that can be applied smoothly across current philosophical and cognitive scientific subdisciplines.},

We have used a  large, novel data set on citations to scientific papers published between 1998 and 2002 drawn from Scopus.

We offer a case study focusing on one research project that resulted in a published paper advancing a new understanding of the mechanism by which the central circadian oscillator in Synechococcus elongatus controls gene expression. By examining how the diagrams prepared for the paper developed over the course of multiple drafts, we show how the process of generating a new explanation vitally involved the development and integration of multiple versions of different types of diagrams, and how reasoning about the mechanism proceeded in tandem with the development of the diagrams used to represent it.},

However, only count-based information is involved as the input of ACA, which is not sufficiently informative for knowledge representations. This article catches several metadata in full text of citing papers but not aims at content-level information, which increases the amount of information input to ACA without increasing computational complexity a lot. We propose a new method by involving information including the number of mentioned times in a citing paper and the number of context words in a citing sentence. We combine these pieces of information into the traditional ACA and compare the results between ACA and the proposed approach by using factor analysis, network analysis, and MDS-measurement. The result of our empirical study indicates that compared with the traditional ACA, the proposed method shows a better clustering performance in visualizations and reveals more details in displaying intellectual structures.},

Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing attachment styles, global self-esteem, and self-perceived competence across a variety of life domains (e.g., athletics, social skills). Results showed that secure and dismissing participants reported higher global self-esteem and greater average competence than did either preoccupied or fearful participants. Significant differences in competence across attachment styles, however, occurred only in socially relevant domains. A commonality analysis indicated that both attachment styles and domain-specific competence accounted for significant independent portions of the variance in global self-esteem, as did the overlap between these two variables. Results are discussed in terms of the conceptual relation between attachment styles and the self.},

The scope of the present paper is to introduce a simple model describing the growth of scientific/technological research impact, in the specific case where science is the main source of a new idea driving a technological development, leading to ``hype-type'' evolution curves. The main idea of the model is that, in a first stage, the growth of the scientific interest of a new specific field (as can be measured by publication numbers) basically follows the classical ``logistic'' growth curve. At a second stage, starting at a later trigger time, the technological development based on that scientific idea (as can be measured by patent deposits) can be described as the integral (in a mathematical sense) of the first curve, since technology is based on the overall accumulated scientific knowledge. The model is preliminary tested through a bibliometric analysis of the publication and patent deposit rate for organic light emitting diodes scientific research and technology.},

Many documents do not come with descriptive terms, thus requiring humans to generate keywords on-the-fly. The need to automate this kind of task demands the development of keyword extraction systems with the ability to automatically identify keywords within the text. One approach is to resort to machinelearning algorithms. These, however, depend on large annotated text corpora, which are not always available. An alternative solution is to consider an unsupervised approach. In this article, we describe YAKE!, a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Our system does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. To demonstrate the merits and significance of YAKE!, we compare it against ten state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and one supervised method. Experimental results carried out on top of twenty datasets show that YAKE! significantly outperforms other unsupervised methods on texts of different sizes, languages, and domains.},

  abstract = {What kind of basic research ideas are more likely to get applied in practice? There is a long line of research investigating patterns of knowledge transfer, but it generally focuses on documents as the unit of analysis and follow their transfer into practice for a specific scientific domain. Here we study translational research at the level of scientific concepts for all scientific fields. We do this through text mining and predictive modeling using three corpora: 38.6 million paper abstracts, 4 million patent documents, and 0.28 million clinical trials. We extract scientific concepts (i.e., phrases) from corpora as instantiations of ``research ideas", create concept-level features as motivated by literature, and then follow the trajectories of over 450,000 new concepts (emerged from 1995-2014) to identify factors that lead only a small proportion of these ideas to be used in inventions and drug trials. Results from our analysis suggest several mechanisms that distinguish which scientific concept will be adopted in practice, and which will not. We also demonstrate that our derived features can be used to explain and predict knowledge transfer with high accuracy. Our work provides greater understanding of knowledge transfer for researchers, practitioners, and government agencies interested in encouraging translational research.},

Here we present a scientometric analysis of controversies involving intelligence researchers working in the democratic Western world since 1950. By consulting books and articles, conducting web searches, and contacting some of the individuals involved, we assembled a large database of controversies. Each entry in our database represents a controversy involving a particular individual in a particular year. We computed a measure of controversy by combining the number and severity of incidents, separately for each individual and each year. The individual-level distribution is highly skewed, with just a few individuals accounting for a disproportionate share of the controversy. When tracking the level of controversy over time, we find four relatively distinct `eras', of which the most recent era---the `LCI era'---may be the most significant to date.},

By inductive logic, the chapter indicates a theory of logical probability providing rules for inductive thinking. The chapter also explains the nature and purpose of inductive logic by showing the way it can be used in determining rational decisions. It mentions the term ``probability'' not in the objective sense but in the subjective sense ---for example, as the degree of belief. This is a psychological concept in empirical decision theory, referring to the actual beliefs of actual human beings. The main conceptions of probability are often divided into two kinds, objectivistic and subjectivistic conceptions. These are not two incompatible doctrines concerning the same concept, but two theories that concern two different probability concepts, both of them legitimate and useful. The concept of objective (or statistical) probability is connected with relative frequencies in mass phenomena. It plays an important role in mathematical statistics, and it occurs in the laws of various branches of empirical science, especially physics.},

The analysis concludes that the general factor g exists along with a series of second-order factors that measure broad special abilities. Special facts that should be considered, however, are that more and better tests of factor Gf are needed to establish this factor as linearly independent of factor g. It is recommended that estimates of scores on factor g should be based on multiple regression formulas for determining factor scores rather than simple weighted sums of scores},

Professor Carr shows that the `facts' of history are simply those which historians have selected for scrutiny. Millions have crossed the Rubicon, but the historians tell us that only Caesar's crossing was significant. All historical facts come to us as a result of interpretative choices by historians influenced by the standards of their age. Yet if absolute objectivity is impossible, the role of the historian need in no way suffer; nor does history lose its fascination.   With lucidity, Carr casts a light on the proper function of the historian and the vital importance of history in modern society. -- Provided by publisher. [In this volume, the author] tackles half a dozen of the most fundamental questions concerning the interpretation of human social experience. He handles each of these with such mastery as we seldom see.  -- Provided by publisher.},

  abstract = {Models in physics and economics often offer descriptions of imaginary situations. The descriptions are both thin--not much about the situation is filled in--and unrealistic--what is filled in is not true of many real situations. Yet we want to use the results of these models to draw conclusions about actually occurring situations. In the past I have proposed that we interpret these models as fables. The happenings in the model are only one concrete instantiation of a lesson that is more widely applicable when expressed in more abstract language. But there is a big problem-- and it is a problem that besets not only reasoning from models but reasoning from real experiments as well. How do we know which ladder of abstraction to climb and how far up to go? A fable generally comes with the abstract lesson attached; most well-known parables, by contrast, require an interpretation from outside. Models, unfortunately, tend to be more like parables than fables. The right abstract interpretation is not supplied by the model itself. Where then should it come from?},

To draw quantitative predictions from a model of a mechanism, the model must capture this hierarchical aspect. Recursive Bayesian networks (RBNs) were put forward by Lorenzo Casini et al. as a means to model mechanistic hierarchies by decomposing variables into their constituting causal networks. The proposal was criticized by Alexander Gebharter. He proposes an alternative formalism, which instead decomposes arrows. Here, I defend RBNs from the criticism and argue that they offer a better representation of mechanistic hierarchies than the rival account.},

They offer a more realistic description of micro behavior than traditional climate policy models by allowing for agent heterogeneity, bounded rationality and nonmarket interactions over social networks. This enables the analysis of a broader spectrum of policies. Here, we review 61 ABM studies addressing climate-energy policy aimed at emissions reduction, product and technology diffusion, and energy conservation. This covers a broad set of instruments of climate policy, ranging from carbon taxation, and emissions trading through adoption subsidies to information provision tools such as smart meters and eco-labels. Our treatment pays specific attention to behavioral assumptions and the structure of social networks. We offer suggestions for future research with ABMs to answer neglected policy questions.

I shall argue that the domain of application commonly attributed to laws is too narrow. That is, laws can still play an important, though peculiar, role outside their strict domain of validity. I shall argue also that, by way of a trade-off, while the actual domain of application of laws should be seen as much broader. At the same time, what I call `anomic' representational elements reveal themselves as central to the descriptive and explanatory power of theories and models: boundary conditions, state descriptions, structures, constraints, limits and mechanisms. I conclude with a brief consideration of how my discussion has consequences for discussion of understanding, unification, approximation and dispositional properties. I focus on examples from physics, macroscopic and microscopic, phenomenological and fundametal: shock waves, propagation of cracks, symmetry breaking, and others. This law-eccentric kind of knowledge is central to both modeling the world and intervening in it.},

However, although previous work evaluates the users' understanding of explanations, factors influencing the decision support are largely overlooked in the literature. This article addresses this gap by studying the impact of               user uncertainty               ,               AI correctness               , and the interaction between               AI uncertainty               and               explanation logic-styles               for classification tasks. We conducted two separate studies: one requesting participants to recognize handwritten digits and one to classify the sentiment of reviews. To assess the decision making, we analyzed the               task performance, agreement               with the AI suggestion, and the user's               reliance               on the XAI interface elements. Participants make their decision relying on three pieces of information in the XAI interface (image or text instance, AI prediction, and explanation). Participants were shown one explanation style (between-participants design) according to three styles of logical reasoning (inductive, deductive, and abductive). This allowed us to study how different levels of AI uncertainty influence the effectiveness of different explanation styles. The results show that user uncertainty and AI correctness on predictions significantly affected users' classification decisions considering the analyzed metrics. In both domains (images and text), users relied mainly on the instance to decide. Users were usually overconfident about their choices, and this evidence was more pronounced for text. Furthermore, the inductive style explanations led to overreliance on the AI advice in both domains---it was the most persuasive, even when the AI was incorrect. The abductive and deductive styles have complex effects depending on the domain and the AI uncertainty levels.},

For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We find that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias.

The model, which is based on linear interactions, captures in good approximation the spatiotemporal dynamics of a football team. Our theoretical framework, therefore, becomes an effective analytical tool to uncover the underlying cooperative mechanisms behind the complexity of football plays.

These are familiar terms from the Yijing as well as other philosophical texts from ancient China. It begins with a comparative inquiry into Chinese and Greek attitudes toward time and then explores the related philosophical consequences. Although the ancient Chinese view of the world as temporal, processual, and relational may be found to be in contrast with Greek substance-oriented philosophy, it is argued here that we should revise some commonly accepted interpretations of Chinese terms. Without adequate reflection on temporality and process, many important terms may be misconstrued as atemporal and substance-oriented, which would be alien to the sensibilities of East Asian traditions. Thus, it is attempted here to gauge the adequacy of the prominent existing interpretations of these terms and ideas while giving an account of how such interpretations may be revised to better recognize the role of temporality and process. Specifically, it is proposed that the interpretations given here accord best with a conception of time as a spiral trajectory, as opposed to either the cyclic or linear conceptions of time usually considered dominant in the Yijing and ancient Chinese philosophy.},

The spoken and written language of a society affords a unique way to measure the magnitude and prevalence of these widely shared collective representations. Here, we used word embeddings to systematically quantify gender stereotypes in language corpora that are unprecedented in size (65+ million words) and scope (child and adult conversations, books, movies, TV). Across corpora, gender stereotypes emerged consistently and robustly for both theoretically selected stereotypes (e.g., work--home) and comprehensive lists of more than 600 personality traits and more than 300 occupations. Despite underlying differences across language corpora (e.g., time periods, formats, age groups), results revealed the pervasiveness of gender stereotypes in every corpus. Using gender stereotypes as the focal issue, we unite 19th-century theories of collective representations and 21st-century evidence on implicit social cognition to understand the subtle yet persistent presence of collective representations in language.},

  abstract = {Epistemologies and research methods are not free of metaphysics. This is to say that they are both, supported by (or presumed by), and support (or presume) fundamental ontologies. A discussion of the epistemological foundations of ``multimethod'' research in the social sciences---in as much as such research claims to unearth ``causal'' relations---therefore cannot avoid the ontological presuppositions or implications of such a discussion. But though there isn't necessarily a perfect correspondence between ontology, epistemology, and methodology, they do constrain each other. As such it is possible to make methodological choices that are at odds with one's (implicit) ontology or argue from an ontology that is inconsistent one's choice of methods. Yet lack of recognition of this fact has hampered methodological discussions in political science, especially with respect to the discussion on the merits of multimethod research. The ontology implicitly accepted in such discussions is ``reductionist'' and ``regularist,'' that is, one that respectively defines causes in terms of noncausal relations and states of affair and affirms that such noncausal relations are regularities in nature. This article will argue that any attempt to fit ``multimethod'' research (where ``multimethod'' signifies some combination of inferential statistics and case studies) within this narrow ontology is destined to fail since such a metaphysics logically cannot accord case studies a necessary or sufficient role in the in the establishment of causal relations. However, there are metaphysical positions within the ambit of an empiricist philosophy of science that can accommodate multiple methods without contradiction. The article discusses two such ontologies and suggests ways in which they might allow the establishment of a coherent epistemological foundation for multimethod research, however, within a decidedly empiricist philosophy of science.},

Our benchmarking results demonstrate that the BioSentVec embeddings can better capture sentence semantics compared to the other competitive alternatives and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing has been widely used by biology researchers. There are many analysis tools developed accordingly. However, almost all of them use log transformation in the process of normalization, which may result in system bias on global features of datasets. It is considered that they may not be suitable for researchers who expect local and detailed features of datasets, such as rare cell population and independent expressed genes. In this study, we developed a method called t-SNE transformation to replace log transformation. We found that it can well respond to some specific bio-markers in real datasets. When the cluster number was changed, t-SNE transformation was steadier than log transformation. Further study showed that clustering after t-SNE transformation detected the residual cells more accurately after majority cells of one type were removed manually. It was also sensitive to a highly-variated independent gene added artificially. In conclusion, t-SNE transformation is an alternative normalization for detecting local features, especially interests arouse in cell types with rare populations or highly-variated but independently expressed genes.},

While it is often sufficient to explore only the summary statistics of a dataset (e.g., min/mean/max), Anscombe's Quartet demonstrates how such statistics can be misleading. We consider a similar problem in the context of graph mining. To study the relationships between different graph properties and statistics, we examine all low-order ({$\leq$} 10) non-isomorphic graphs and provide a simple visual analytics system to explore correlations across multiple graph properties. However, for graphs with more than ten nodes, generating the entire space of graphs becomes quickly intractable. We use different random graph generation methods to further look into the distribution of graph statistics for higher order graphs and investigate the impact of various sampling methodologies. We also describe a method for generating many graphs that are identical over a number of graph properties and statistics yet are clearly different and identifiably distinct.},

The method focuses on the interrelations between a co-citation cluster's members and their citers. The generic method is applied to a three-part analysis of the field of Information Science as defined by 12 journals published between 1996 and 2008: 1) a comparative author co-citation analysis (ACA), 2) a progressive ACA of a time series of co-citation networks, and 3) a progressive document co-citation analysis (DCA). Results show that the multipleperspective method increases the interpretability and accountability of both ACA and DCA networks.},

To better understand this overlap, we extend recent work on finding syntactic trees in neural networks' internal representations to the multilingual setting. We show that subspaces of mBERT representations recover syntactic tree distances in languages other than English, and that these subspaces are approximately shared across languages. Motivated by these results, we present an unsupervised analysis method that provides evidence mBERT learns representations of syntactic dependency labels, in the form of clusters which largely agree with the Universal Dependencies taxonomy. This evidence suggests that even without explicit supervision, multilingual masked language models learn certain linguistic universals.},

The Chinese term Silk Road (sichou zhi lu; 丝绸之路) first gained currency after the 1955 Afro-Asian Conference in Bandung as part of the lexicon of anticolonial solidarity. During the Cold War, China's Afro-Asian Silk Road, different from the West's Europe-Asia Silk Road, prompted new interest in the linguistic dimension of connected history. Language contact traditionally held limited significance in European and Chinese philology because linguistic divisions were understood in terms of nation or language family. For Afro-Asian scholars and writers, however, precolonial language contact became a portent of postcolonial exchange. They shifted attention from genetic word roots to historical routes (e.g., loanwords). Within a longer history of what I call ``contact philology,'' China's short-lived collaborations refashioned the Orient as Afro-Asia and presented an (unfinished) critique of the tropes with which we narrate the connected past.},

  abstract = {To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks, such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to ``buy'' arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience, as critical pieces to be accounted for in characterizing intelligent systems. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a new benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.},

  abstract = {We study the spatiotemporal correlation of terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda, ISIS, and local insurgents, in six geographical areas identified via \$k\$-means clustering applied to the Global Terrorism Database. All surveyed organizations exhibit near-repeat activity whereby a prior attack increases the likelihood of a subsequent one by the same group within 20km and on average 4 (al Qaeda) to 10 (ISIS) weeks. Near-response activity, whereby an attack by a given organization elicits further attacks from a different one, is found to depend on the adversarial, neutral or collaborative relationship between the two. When in conflict, local insurgents respond quickly to attacks by global terror groups while global terror groups delay their responses to local insurgents, leading to an asymmetric dynamic. When neutral or allied, attacks by one group enhance the response likelihood of the other, regardless of hierarchy. These trends arise consistently in all clusters for which data is available. Government intervention and spill-over effects are also discussed; we find no evidence of outbidding. Understanding the regional dynamics of terrorism may be greatly beneficial in policy-making and intervention design.},

However, the agent-based models (ABMs) commonly used for such simulations lack fidelity to human behavior. We propose a new approach to simulating opinion dynamics based on populations of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our findings reveal a strong inherent bias in LLM agents towards accurate information, leading to consensus in line with scientific reality. However, this bias limits the simulation of individuals with resistant views on issues like climate change. After inducing confirmation bias through prompt engineering, we observed opinion fragmentation in line with existing agent-based research. These insights highlight the promise and limitations of LLM agents in this domain and suggest a path forward: refining LLMs with real-world discourse to better simulate the evolution of human beliefs.},

  abstract = {Existing relationships among time series can be exploited as inductive biases in learning effective forecasting models. In hierarchical time series, relationships among subsets of sequences induce hard constraints (hierarchical inductive biases) on the predicted values. In this paper, we propose a graph-based methodology to unify relational and hierarchical inductive biases in the context of deep learning for time series forecasting. In particular, we model both types of relationships as dependencies in a pyramidal graph structure, with each pyramidal layer corresponding to a level of the hierarchy. By exploiting modern - trainable - graph pooling operators we show that the hierarchical structure, if not available as a prior, can be learned directly from data, thus obtaining cluster assignments aligned with the forecasting objective. A differentiable reconciliation stage is incorporated into the processing architecture, allowing hierarchical constraints to act both as an architectural bias as well as a regularization element for predictions. Simulation results on representative datasets show that the proposed method compares favorably against the state of the art.},

This would in turn legitimate the full participation of women in society.

  abstract = {The faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network---who hires whose graduates as faculty---we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines.

  abstract = {The faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network---who hires whose graduates as faculty---we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a U.S. News \& World Report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system.

Measuring the ability of theories and models to predict unobserved behaviors provides a principled method to evaluate their merit and, thus, to help establish which mechanisms are most plausible. Here, we propose models and develop rigorous inference approaches to predict strategic decisions in dyadic social dilemmas. In particular, we use bipartite stochastic block models that incorporate information about the dilemmas faced by individuals. We show, combining these models with empirical data on strategic decisions in dyadic social dilemmas, that individual strategic decisions are to a large extent predictable, despite not being ``rational.'' The analysis of these models also allows us to conclude that: (i) individuals do not perceive games according their game-theoretical structure; (ii) individuals make decisions using combinations of multiple simple strategies, which our approach reveals naturally.},

After explaining how this methodological crisis differs from an earlier stand-off between proponents of microhistory and total history, this paper suggests a role for intellectual history in moving us beyond the current debate. What is needed is a history of ``scaling''; that is, we need to historicize the process of mediating between different frameworks of measurement, even those that might at first appear incommensurable. Historical examples are explored in which such a process of commensuration has allowed for a pluralism of perceptions of space and time.}

At a high level, linguistic features seem to be represented in separate semantic and syntactic subspaces. We find evidence of a fine-grained geometric representation of word senses.

Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, SPECTER can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SciDocs, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that SPECTER outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.},

This coverage sensibly decreases going backwards in time. Citation mining of humanities publications -- defined as an instance of bibliometric data mining and as a means to the end of building comprehensive citation indexes -- remains an open problem. In this contribution we discuss the results of two recent projects in this area: Cited Loci and Linked Books. The former focused on the domain of classics, using journal articles in JSTOR as a corpus; the latter considered the historiography on Venice and a novel corpus of journals and monographs. Both projects attempted to mine citations of all kinds -- abbreviated and not, to all types of sources, including primary sources -- and considered a wide time span (19th to 21st century). We first discuss the current state of research in citation mining of humanities publications. We then present the various steps involved into this process, from corpus selection to data publication, discussing the peculiarities of the humanities. The approaches taken by the two projects are compared, allowing us to highlight disciplinary differences and commonalities, as well as shared challenges between historiography and classics on this respect. The resulting picture portrays humanities citation mining as a field with a great, yet mostly untapped potential, and a few still open challenges. The potential lies in using citations as a means to interconnect digitized collections at a large scale, by making explicit the linking function of bibliographic citations. As for the open challenges, a key issue is the existing need for an integrated metadata infrastructure and an appropriate legal framework to facilitate citation mining in the humanities.},

An open question relates to the structural role of core literature: highly cited sources, naturally playing a disproportionate role in the definition of intellectual landscapes. We introduce four indicators in order to map the structural role played by core sources into connecting different areas of the intellectual landscape of citing publications (i.e. communities in the bibliographic coupling network). All indicators factor out the influence of degree distributions by internalizing a null configuration model. By considering several datasets focused on history, we show that two distinct structural actions are performed by the core literature: a global one, by connecting otherwise separated communities in the landscape, or a local one, by rising connectivity within communities. In our study, the global action is mainly performed by small sets of scholarly monographs, reference works and primary sources, while the rest of the core, and especially most journal articles, acts mostly locally.},

Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. \&lt;img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/\&gt; Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects. Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.

In this paper we distinguish between different types of trading zone by asking whether the collaboration is co-operative or coerced and whether the end-state is a heterogeneous or homogeneous culture. In so doing, we find that the voluntary development of a new language community---what we call an inter-language trading zone---represents only one of four possible configurations. In developing this argument we show how different modes of collaboration result in different kinds of trading zone, how different kinds of trading zone may be `nested' inside each other and discuss how a single collaboration might move between different kinds of trading zone over time. One implication of our analysis is that interactional expertise is a central component of at least one class of trading zone.},

Advocates tend to endorse functionalism, on which collectives are analogous to complicated robots. This is puzzling: we don't hold robots blameworthy. I argue we don't hold robots blameworthy because blameworthiness presupposes the capacity for a mental state I call `moral self-awareness'. This raises a new problem for collective blameworthiness: collectives seem to lack the capacity for moral self-awareness. I solve the problem by giving an account of how collectives have this capacity. The trick is to take seriously individuals' status as flesh-and-blood material constituents of collectives. The idea will be: under certain conditions that I specify, an individual can be the locus of a collective's moral self-awareness. The account provides general insights concerning collectives' dependence on members, the boundaries of membership, and the locus of collectives' phenomenology.},

Such team reasoning requires collective preferences and a distinctive mode of reasoning from preferences to decisions. Findings from two experiments provide evidence for collective preferences and team reasoning. In lifelike vignettes (Experiment 1) and abstract games (Experiment 2) with certain structural properties, most players preferred team-reasoning strategies to strategies supporting unique Nash equilibria, although individually rational players should choose equilibrium strategies. These findings suggest that team reasoning predicts strategy choices more powerfully than orthodox game theory in some games.},

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data.

XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7\% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4\% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code, data and models publicly available.},

  abstract = {The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90\%--100\% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97\% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97\% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming (`no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97\% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract           High-dimensional data are becoming increasingly common in nearly all areas of science. Developing approaches to analyze these data and understand their meaning is a pressing issue. This is particularly true for the rapidly growing field of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), a technique that simultaneously measures the expression of tens of thousands of genes in thousands to millions of single cells. The emerging consensus for analysis workflows reduces the dimensionality of the dataset before performing downstream analysis, such as assignment of cell types. One problem with this approach is that dimensionality reduction can introduce substantial distortion into the data; consider the familiar example of trying to represent the three-dimensional earth as a two-dimensional map. It is currently unclear if such distortion affects analysis of scRNA-Seq data sets. Here, we introduce a straightforward approach to quantifying this distortion by comparing the local neighborhoods of points before and after dimensionality reduction. We found that popular techniques like t-SNE and UMAP introduce substantial distortion even for relatively simple geometries such as simulated hyperspheres. For scRNA-Seq data, we found the distortion in local neighborhoods was often greater than 95\% in the representations typically used for downstream analysis. This high level of distortion can readily introduce important errors into cell type identification, pseudotime ordering, and other analyses that rely on local relationships. We found that principal component analysis can generate accurate embeddings of the data, but only when using dimensionalities that are much higher than typically used in scRNA-Seq analysis. We suggest approaches to take these findings into account and call for a new generation of dimensional reduction algorithms that can accurately embed high dimensional data in its true latent dimension.},

Like the earlier volume, this new collection of studies includes ethnographic, historical and discourse-analytic approaches to scientific knowledge-making. It revisits representation in scientific practice not only by focusing on novel technologies, sciences, and institutional arrangements that have emerged in recent decades, but also by respecifying recurrent themes in light of novel conceptual and institutional loci for interrogating those themes.},

Saying `never' is absolutely internalist, while `sometimes' rejects this absolutely internalist rule. To show that `sometimes' is the better answer, I examine two case histories from the early modern period: these cases, framed by a taxonomy of historical narrative, eliminate absolute internalism.},

We combine this network with information on the industrial composition and export baskets of national economies. The business travel network helps to predict which economic activities will grow in a country, which new activities will develop and which old activities will be abandoned. In statistical terms, business travel has the most substantial impact among a range of bilateral relationships between countries, such as trade, foreign direct investments and migration. Moreover, our analysis suggests that this impact is causal: business travel from countries specializing in a specific industry causes growth in that economic activity in the destination country. Our interpretation of this is that business travel helps to diffuse knowledge, and we use our estimates to assess which countries contribute or benefit the most from the diffusion of knowledge through global business travel.},

First, unless we accept to have scientific theories rest on the authority of a small number of researchers, empirical studies should be replicable, in the sense that its methods and procedure should be detailed enough for someone else to conduct the same study. Second, for empirical results to provide a solid foundation for scientific theorizing, they should also be replicable, in the sense that most attempts at replicating the original study that produced them would yield similar results. The XPhi Replicability Project is primarily concerned with replicability in the second sense, that is: the replicability of results.  In the past year, several projects have shed doubt on the replicability of key findings in psychology, and most notably social psychology. Because the methods of experimental philosophy have often been close to the ones used in social psychology, it is only natural to wonder to which extent the results experimental philosophers ground their theory are replicable. The aim of the XPhi Replicability Project is precisely to reach a reliable estimate of the replicability of empirical results in experimental philosophy.  To this end, several research teams across the world will replicate around 40 studies in experimental philosophy, some among the most cited, others drawn at random. The results of the project will be published in a special issue of the Review of Philosophy and Psychology dedicated to the topic of replicability in cognitive science.The official website of the project can be found here :https://sites.google.com/site/thexphireplicabilityproject/homeThe project can also be followed on social medias:https://twitter.com/XPhiReplicationhttps://www.facebook.com/XPhiReplicabilityProject/}

  abstract = {Imagine the following alternative history of the world: Thingsare qualitatively just as they actually are. There is nodifference in anything like the shape, size, or mass of objects. Thereis no difference in the number of entities. Even so, there isa non-qualitative difference and it concerns you inparticular. According to this alternative history, you fail toexist. In your place, there is a distinct individual, Double. Doublehas all the qualitative properties, whether mental or physical, youactually have, but, despite all these similarities, you and Double aredistinct individuals. So, according to this alternative history, youdo not exist., Is this alternative history of the world a possible one? And whatshould we make of other alleged qualitatively indiscerniblepossibilities? For example, is it possible for a pair of siblings toswap their actual qualitative roles---i.e., where the actuallyfirstborn twin is born second and vice versa---but whereno qualitative features of the world are altered? In a similar vein,suppose, following Black (1952), that there could be a worldcontaining only two qualitatively indiscernible iron spheres. Arethere yet other possible worlds where these spheres ``swap''their respective spatial locations or are ``replaced'' bynumerically distinct yet qualitatively indiscernibledoppelg{\"a}ngers?, An affirmative answer to these questionsentails haecceitism, according to which the world coulddiffer non-qualitatively without differing qualitatively. So, if thealternative history described above where Double replaces you is agenuine possibility, it is a maximal possibility---i.e.,a total way the world could be---that differshaecceitistically from actuality. Similarly, if it is possiblefor twins to swap their birth orders while leaving all qualitativematters unchanged, that maximal possibility also differshaecceitistically from actuality., According to anti-haecceitism, there are no haecceitisticdifferences between maximal possibilities. Anti-haecceitism thereforeholds that the world could not be haecceitistically different withoutbeing qualitatively different. So, for anti-haecceitists, thealternative history of the world described above is not possible norare there are distinct maximal possibilities that differ solely interms of individuals ``swapping'' their qualitative roles orbeing ``replaced'' by non-actual individuals., This entry is a general overview of the issues raised byhaecceitism and anti-haecceitism. In Sections One through Three,various formulations of haecceitism are presented and the connectionsbetween haecceitism, haecceities, and essentialism are examined. InSections Four and Five, arguments for and against haecceitism aresurveyed. Section Six discusses the scope of haecceitistic differencesand the prospects for accepting only certain kinds of haecceitisticdifferences. Finally, Section Seven briefly notes the significance ofhaecceitism and its denial within various areas of metaphysics.},

It is argued here that although the connections to logic and science have been important in the development of analytic philosophy, these connections do not come close to characterizing the nature of analytic philosophy, either as a body of doctrines or as a philosophical method. We will do better to understand analytic philosophy---and its relationship to continental philosophy---if we see it as a historically constructed collection of texts, which define its key problems and concerns. It is true, however, that analytic philosophy has paid little attention to the history of the subject. This is both its strength---since it allows for a distinctive kind of creativity---and its weakness---since ignoring history can encourage a philosophical variety of "normal science."},

  abstract = {Rand (1971) proposed what has since become a well-known index for comparing two partitions obtained on the same set of units. The index takes a value on the interval between 0 and 1, where a higher value indicates more similar partitions. Sometimes, e.g. when the units are observed in two time periods, the splitting and merging of clusters should be considered differently, according to the operationalization of the stability of clusters. The Rand Index is symmetric in the sense that both the splitting and merging of clusters lower the value of the index. In such a non-symmetric case, one of the Wallace indexes (Wallace, 1983) can be used. Further, there are several cases when one wants to compare two partitions obtained on different sets of units, where the intersection of these sets of units is a non-empty set of units. In this instance, the new units and units which leave the clusters from the first partition can be considered as a factor lowering the value of the index. Therefore, a modified Rand index is presented. Because the splitting and merging of clusters have to be considered differently in some situations, an asymmetric modified Wallace Index is also proposed. For all presented indices, the correction for chance is described, which allows different values of a selected index to be compared.},

  abstract = {Linear dimensionality reduction methods are a cornerstone of analyzing high dimensional data, due to their simple geometric interpretations and typically attractive computational properties. These methods capture many data features of interest, such as covariance, dynamical structure, correlation between data sets, input-output relationships, and margin between data classes. Methods have been developed with a variety of names and motivations in many fields, and perhaps as a result the connections between all these methods have not been highlighted. Here we survey methods from this disparate literature as optimization programs over matrix manifolds. We discuss principal component analysis, factor analysis, linear multidimensional scaling, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, canonical correlations analysis, maximum autocorrelation factors, slow feature analysis, sufficient dimensionality reduction, undercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance metric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which accepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output, an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization framework further allows straightforward generalizations and novel variants of classical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an orthogonal-projection canonical correlations analysis. More broadly, this survey and generic solver suggest that linear dimensionality reduction can move toward becoming a blackbox, objective-agnostic numerical technology.},

  abstract = {Our epistemic access to the past is infamously patchy: historical information degrades and disappears and bygone eras are often beyond the reach of repeatable experiments. However, historical scientists have been remarkably successful at uncovering and explaining the past. I argue that part of this success is explained by the exploitation of dependencies between historical events, entities, and processes. For instance, if sauropod dinosaurs were hot blooded, they must have been gluttons; the high-energy demands of endothermy restrict sauropod grazing strategies. Understanding such dependencies extends our reach into the past in spite of incomplete data. In addition, this serves as a counterexample to two accounts of method in the historical sciences. By one, historical science proceeds by identifying `smoking guns': traces that discriminate between live hypotheses. By the other, historical hypotheses are supported by consilience: the convergence of independent lines of evidence. However, testing for `coherency' between past hypotheses also plays a critical role in historical confirmation. Just as historical scientists exploit dependencies between past entities and present entities to infer what the past was like, they also exploit dependencies between past entities themselves. I do not suggest that archetypical historical science proceeds in this manner. Rather, the lesson I draw is that historical methodology cannot be characterized as archetypically relying on one method or another. Historical science is at base opportunistic, and is resistant to unitary analyses.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques have become the method of choice for researchers working on algorithmic aspects of recommender systems. With the strongly increased interest in machine learning in general, it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track of what represents the state-of-the-art at the moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the same time, several recent publications point out problems in today's research practice in applied machine learning, e.g., in terms of the reproducibility of the results or the choice of the baselines when proposing new models. In this work, we report the results of a systematic analysis of algorithmic proposals for top-n recommendation tasks. Specifically, we considered 18 algorithms that were presented at top-level research conferences in the last years. Only 7 of them could be reproduced with reasonable effort. For these methods, it however turned out that 6 of them can often be outperformed with comparably simple heuristic methods, e.g., based on nearest-neighbor or graph-based techniques. The remaining one clearly outperformed the baselines but did not consistently outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking method. Overall, our work sheds light on a number of potential problems in today's machine learning scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices in this area.

  abstract = {Topology based dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP have seen increasing success and popularity in highdimensional data. These methods have strong mathematical foundations and are based on the intuition that the topology in low dimensions should be close to that of high dimensions. Given that the initial topological structure is a precursor to the success of the algorithm, this naturally raises the question: What makes a ``good'' topological structure for dimensionality reduction? In this paper which focuses on UMAP, we study the effects of node connectivity (k-Nearest Neighbors vs mutual k-Nearest Neighbors) and relative neighborhood (Adjacent via Path Neighbors) on dimensionality reduction. We explore these concepts through extensive ablation studies on 4 standard image and text datasets; MNIST, FMNIST, 20NG, AG, reducing to 2 and 64 dimensions. Our findings indicate that a more refined notion of connectivity (mutual k-Nearest Neighbors with minimum spanning tree) together with a flexible method of constructing the local neighborhood (Path Neighbors), can achieve a much better representation than default UMAP, as measured by downstream clustering performance.},

They appear to use very different loss functions with different motivations, and the exact relationship between them has been unclear. Here we show that UMAP is effectively negative sampling applied to the \$t\$-SNE loss function. We explain the difference between negative sampling and noise-contrastive estimation (NCE), which has been used to optimize \$t\$-SNE under the name NCVis. We prove that, unlike NCE, negative sampling learns a scaled data distribution. When applied in the neighbor embedding setting, it yields more compact embeddings with increased attraction, explaining differences in appearance between UMAP and \$t\$-SNE. Further, we generalize the notion of negative sampling and obtain a spectrum of embeddings, encompassing visualizations similar to \$t\$-SNE, NCVis, and UMAP. Finally, we explore the connection between representation learning in the SimCLR setting and neighbor embeddings, and show that (i) \$t\$-SNE can be optimized using the InfoNCE loss and in a parametric setting; (ii) various contrastive losses with only few noise samples can yield competitive performance in the SimCLR setup.},

Here we identify a large sample of published drug-gene interaction claims curated in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (for example, benzo(a)pyrene decreases expression of SLC22A3) and evaluate these claims by connecting them with high-throughput experiments from the LINCS L1000 program. Our sample included 60,159 supporting findings and 4253 opposing findings about 51,292 drug-gene interaction claims in 3363 scientific articles. We show that claims reported in a single paper replicate 19.0\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 16.9--21.2\%) more frequently than expected, while claims reported in multiple papers replicate 45.5\% (95\% CI, 21.8--74.2\%) more frequently than expected. We also analyze the subsample of interactions with two or more published findings (2493 claims; 6272 supporting findings; 339 opposing findings; 1282 research articles), and show that centralized scientific communities, which use similar methods and involve shared authors who contribute to many articles, propagate less replicable claims than decentralized communities, which use more diverse methods and contain more independent teams. Our findings suggest how policies that foster decentralized collaboration will increase the robustness of scientific findings in biomedical research.},

Perhaps the reason is that, on the assumption that the alleged `divide' is so deep, each side feels that there is no point in arguing against the other, for argumentation would quickly be replaced by invective. In this paper I analyse one of the few recent examples of an across-divide debate \- the Searle\- Derrida polemic. Using a threefold typology of debates, I try to show that, in spite of the violent and sarcastic tone employed by both contenders, there is enough common ground, questioning of not-argued-for assumptions, and serious argumentation (on both sides) to consider this debate more than just an irrational dispute.},

Traditional dream analysis practices, while popular and aided by over 130 unique scales and rating systems, have limitations. Mostly based on retrospective surveys or lab studies, they struggle to be applied on a large scale or to show the importance and connections between different dream themes. To overcome these issues, we developed a new, data-driven mixed-method approach for identifying topics in free-form dream reports through natural language processing. We tested this method on 44,213 dream reports from Reddit's r/Dreams subreddit, where we found 217 topics, grouped into 22 larger themes: the most extensive collection of dream topics to date. We validated our topics by comparing it to the widely-used Hall and van de Castle scale. Going beyond traditional scales, our method can find unique patterns in different dream types (like nightmares or recurring dreams), understand topic importance and connections, and observe changes in collective dream experiences over time and around major events, like the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent Russo-Ukrainian war. We envision that the applications of our method will provide valuable insights into the intricate nature of dreaming.},

  abstract = {Agent based modelling is a simulation method in which autonomous agents interact with their environment and one another, given a predefined set of rules. It is an integral method for modelling and simulating complex systems, such as socio-economic problems. Since agent based models are not described by simple and concise mathematical equations, code that generates them is typically complicated, large, and slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based software that provides an ABM analysis platform with minimal code complexity. We compare our software with some of the most popular ABM software in other programming languages. We find that Agents.jl is not only the most performant, but also the least complicated software, providing the same (and sometimes more) features as the competitors with less input required from the user. Agents.jl also integrates excellently with the entire Julia ecosystem, including interactive applications, differential equations, parameter optimization, and more. This removes any ``extensions library'' requirement from Agents.jl, which is paramount in many other tools.},

This includes 175 articles that contained author-submitted keywords, 415 publisher-tagged keywords and 519 articles that had abstracts. Results initially focused on finding the most published authors, most cited articles and most cited authors within the journal, followed by most discussed topics and emerging patterns using keywords and abstracts. The analysis then proceeded to apply social network analysis using Kumu{\copyright} -- a visualization platform for mapping systems and relationships using large datasets. Analysis reveals topic clusters both unique to the journal, and inclusive of the journal's history. Results from this analysis reaffirm the journal's continuing focus on topics in traditional analytic philosophy such as morality, epistemology and knowledge, whilst also featuring topics associated with logic and paradox. This paper presents a new approach to analysing and understanding the historic and emerging topics of interest to the journal, and its readership. This has never previously been done for single philosophy journal. This is historically important given the journal's forthcoming centenary.},

Here, we measure temporal changes in the relevance of proverbs within three corpora, differing in kind, scale, and time frame: Millions of books over centuries; hundreds of millions of news articles over twenty years; and billions of tweets over a decade. We find that proverbs present heavy-tailed frequency-of-usage rank distributions in each venue; exhibit trends reflecting the cultural dynamics of the eras covered; and have evolved into contemporary forms on social media.},

We then point to the importance of distinguishing between the potential offensive and derogatory effects of slur terms, with the former deriving from the impact on the listener of the invoked content itself, and the latter deriving from inferences about speaker attitudes and intentions. We use the resulting framework to discuss several controversial cases of slurs and slurring: (i) terms targeting political views such as `Nazi' and `TERF', and (ii) cases in which non-slurs are used to derogate, as in cases of misgendering. We conclude that what counts as a slur is in part dependent on a background system of ideological assumptions, meaning that whether a particular term counts as a slur will depend in part on one's ideological commitments and assumptions.},

Based on the analysis of co-occurrence data in large data sets, the method creates a measure of ``binding'' that enables the construction of verbal constellations that comprise the larger units, ``concepts,'' that change over time. In contrast to investigation into semantic networks, our method seeks to uncover structures of conceptual operation that are not simply semantic. These larger units of lexical operation that are visualized as interconnected networks may have underlying rules of formation and operation that have as yet unexamined---perhaps tangential---connection to meaning as such. The article is thus exploratory and intended to open the history of concepts to some new avenues of investigation.},

In sustain\- ability transitions that unfold over long periods of time, the maintenance of legitimacy of technologies identified as vital for sustainability becomes a key challenge. In the energy sector, wind power contributes to the transition to an energy system with low greenhouse gas emissions. In Germany, wind power recently faced a series of lawsuits and decreasing investment activity. Therefore, we assess the legitimacy of wind power in Germany by analyzing newspaper articles from four national newspapers from 2009 to 2018. A large amount of articles motivates the use of topic models, sentiment analysis, and statistics to shed light on the changing alignment of wind power with its context. The results show that various issues temporarily gain prominence on the agenda. Lately, the legitimacy of wind power in Germany has been increasingly challenged by adverse effects on humans, animals, and landscapes. Policymakers and project developers may address aspects of pragmatic legitimacy, such as civic participation and the local distribution of profits.},

  abstract = {The analysis of literary works has experienced a surge in computer-assisted processing. To obtain insights into the community structures and social interactions portrayed in novels, the creation of social networks from novels has gained popularity. Many methods rely on identifying named entities and relations for the construction of these networks, but many of these tools are not specifically created for the literary domain. Furthermore, many of the studies on information extraction from literature typically focus on 19th and early 20th century source material. Because of this, it is unclear if these techniques are as suitable to modern-day literature as they are to those older novels. We present a study in which we evaluate natural language processing tools for the automatic extraction of social networks from novels as well as their network structure. We find that there are no significant differences between old and modern novels but that both are subject to a large amount of variance. Furthermore, we identify several issues that complicate named entity recognition in our set of novels and we present methods to remedy these. We see this work as a step in creating more culturally-aware AI systems.},

  abstract = {Is there progress in philosophy? If so, how much? Philosophers have recently argued for a wide range of answers to these questions, from the view that there is no progress whatsoever to the view that philosophy has provided answers to all the big philosophical questions. However, these views are difficult to compare and evaluate, because they rest on very different assumptions about the conditions under which philosophy would make progress. This paper looks to the comparatively mature debate about scientific progress for inspiration on how to formulate four distinct accounts of philosophical progress, in terms of truthlikeness, problem-solving, knowledge, and understanding. Equally importantly, the paper outlines a common framework for how to understand and evaluate these accounts. We distill a series of lessons from this exercise, to help pave the way for a more fruitful discussion about philosophical progress in the future.},

The evolutionary transitions from prokaryotes to unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans were accompanied by major innovations in metabolic design. Here we show that the scalings of metabolic rate, population growth rate, and production efficiency with body size have changed across the evolutionary transitions. Metabolic rate scales with body mass superlinearly in prokaryotes, linearly in protists, and sublinearly in metazoans, so Kleiber's 3/4 power scaling law does not apply universally across organisms. The scaling of maximum population growth rate shifts from positive in prokaryotes to negative in protists and metazoans, and the efficiency of production declines across these groups. Major changes in metabolic processes during the early evolution of life overcame existing constraints, exploited new opportunities, and imposed new constraints.},

In particular, we argue for the centrality of event coreference and therefore incorporate such a component based on topicality. We present the first detailed breakdown of performance on this task. Detecting some types of contradiction requires deeper inferential paths than our system is capable of, but we achieve good performance on types arising from negation and antonymy.},

By analyzing the interactions of multiple generative agents using GPT3.5-turbo as a language model, we demonstrate their ability to not only mimic individual human linguistic behavior but also exhibit collective phenomena intrinsic to human societies, in particular the emergence of scale-free networks. We discovered that this process is disrupted by a skewed token prior distribution of GPT3.5-turbo, which can lead to networks with extreme centralization as a kind of alignment. We show how renaming agents removes these token priors and allows the model to generate a range of networks from random networks to more realistic scale-free networks.},

According to Ulrich Schneider's calculations, from 1810 through 1899, 148 original textbooks by 114 authors were published in German. The aim of this article is to analyse how the documented in these publications canonic vision of 19th century German philosophy evolved. An analysis of 66 treatises published from 1802 through 1918 allows dividing 19th century philosophers into groups based on the frequency of their names across the tables of contents, describing the changes in the leading group composition and in the share of attention received by a given philosopher over time (the patterns of attention for Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Schelling, Herbart, Schleiermacher, Schopenhauer, Jacobi and Fries are discussed in detail). The paper presents thus a formal analysis of how historical reputations of philosophers were made, how they stabilised, or faded. The authors claim that the current understanding of the history of 19th century philosophy differs significantly from the one recorded in the German textbooks of the era (e.g. Herbart's key position within the 19th century philosophical Canon; Schopenhauer's recognition by university philosophers during his own lifetime).},

The most puzzling finding is that there was a rapid growth in the number of journals at the end of the eighteenth century followed by a long decline in numbers that lasted almost a century. This paper analyses the structure of the boom in philosophical periodicals after 1888, followed by the effects of both World Wars, and identifies the communication crisis that occurred at the height of the Weimar Republic.},

In this context, popular social media users play a major role, as they have the ability to broadcast messages to large audiences and influence public opinion. In this article, we make use of openly available data to study the behavior of popular users discussing the pandemic on Twitter. We tackle the issue from a network perspective, considering users as nodes and following relationships as directed edges. The resulting network structure is modeled by embedding the actors in a latent social space, where users closer to one another have a higher probability of following each other. The results suggest the existence of two distinct communities, which can be interpreted as ``generally pro'' and ``generally against'' vaccine mandates, corroborating existing evidence on the pervasiveness of echo chambers on the platform. By focusing on a number of notable users, such as politicians, activists, and news outlets, we further show that the two groups are not entirely homogeneous, and that not just the two poles are represented. To the contrary, the latent space captures an entire spectrum of beliefs between the two extremes, demonstrating that polarization, while present, is not the only driver of the network, and that more moderate, ``central'' users are key players in the discussion.},

This idea has thus far been developed in combination with the more traditional representational approach: accordingly, current artifactualist accounts treat models as representational tools. But artifactualism and representationalism are independent views, and adopting one does not require acceptance of the other. This paper argues that a leaner version of artifactualism, free of representationalist assumptions, is both desirable and viable. Taking seriously the idea that models are artifacts can help us philosophically to make sense of how and why scientific modeling works even without reference to representation.},

Since understanding is typically associated with the pragmatic and psychological dimensions of explanation, shifting the focus from explanation to understanding may induce a shift from accounts that embody normative ideals to accounts that provide accurate descriptions of scientific practice. Not surprisingly, many `friends of understanding' sympathize with a naturalistic approach to the philosophy of science. However, this raises the question of whether the proposed theories of understanding can still have normative power. In this paper I address this question by examining two theories of scientific understanding: Jan Faye's pragmatic-rhetorical theory and my own contextual theory of scientific understanding. I argue that both theories leave room for normativity, despite their naturalistic tendencies. The normative power of my contextual theory is illustrated with a case study of the chemical revolution.},

Graphical mapping of cells in trajectory space allows unsupervised reconstruction and exploration of complex developmental sequences. Applied to flow and mass cytometry data, the method faithfully reconstructs thymic T cell development and reveals development and trafficking regulation of tonsillar B cells. Applied to the single cell transcriptome of mouse intestine and C. elegans, the method recapitulates development from intestinal stem cells to specialized epithelial phenotypes more faithfully than existing algorithms and orders C. elegans cells concordantly to the associated embryonic time. tSpace profiling of complex populations is well suited for hypothesis generation in developing cell systems.},

The trainees were assessed at the start of VET, 1.5 years later, and another 1.5 years after that, just before graduation. Longitudinal latent change score analyses were applied. Bivariate analyses investigated life satisfaction and job strain as social and work-related aspects that are potentially reciprocally related to personality development. Mean-level personality changes included increases in neuroticism and decreases in agreeableness and conscientiousness in the first interval. In the second interval, neuroticism decreased and conscientiousness increased. Simultaneously, trainees reported a gradual decrease in extraversion and openness across the 3-year time span. Personality, especially agreeableness and conscientiousness, emerged as a stronger predictor of changes in job strain and life satisfaction than vice versa. For example, more agreeable and more conscientious trainees subsequently showed increases in life satisfaction. Trainees reporting higher job strain subsequently showed decreases in agreeableness. Trajectories of personality development partly support the maturity principle that has been established in many college student samples.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Booming and busting populations modulate the accumulation of genetic diversity, encoding histories of living populations in present-day variation. Many methods exist to decode these histories, and all must make strong model assumptions. It is typical to assume that mutations accumulate uniformly across the genome at a constant rate that does not vary between closely related populations. However, recent work shows that mutational processes in human and great ape populations vary across genomic regions and evolve over time. This perturbs the             mutation spectrum             : the relative mutation rates in different local nucleotide contexts. Here, we develop theoretical tools in the framework of Kingman's coalescent to accommodate mutation spectrum dynamics. We describe             mushi             : a method to perform fast, nonparametric joint inference of demographic and mutation spectrum histories from allele frequency data. We use             mushi             to reconstruct trajectories of effective population size and mutation spectrum divergence between human populations, identify mutation signatures and their dynamics in different human populations, and produce more accurate time calibration for a previously-reported mutational pulse in the ancestors of Europeans. We show that mutation spectrum histories can be productively incorporated in a well-studied theoretical setting, and rigorously inferred from genomic variation data like other features of evolutionary history.},

This mapping is defined in terms of eigenfunctions of a matrix of interpoint dissimilarities. In this paper we analyze in detail multidimensional scaling applied to a specific dataset: the 2005 United States House of Representatives roll call votes. Certain MDS and kernel projections output ``horseshoes'' that are characteristic of dimensionality reduction techniques. We show that, in general, a latent ordering of the data gives rise to these patterns when one only has local information. That is, when only the interpoint distances for nearby points are known accurately. Our results provide a rigorous set of results and insight into manifold learning in the special case where the manifold is a curve.},

The central problem addressed is how several agents can collectively learn to coordinate their actions such that they complete a given task together without conflicts. However, sequential decision-making under uncertainty is one of the most challenging issues for intelligent cooperative systems. To address this, we propose a multi-agent concurrent framework where agents learn coordinated behaviors in order to divide their areas of responsibility. The proposed framework is an extension of some recent deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as DQN, double DQN, and dueling network architectures. Then, we investigate how the learned behaviors change according to the dynamics of the environment, reward scheme, and network structures. Next, we show how agents behave and choose their actions such that the resulting joint actions are optimal. We finally show that our method can lead to stable solutions in our specific environment.},

  abstract = {Temporal word embeddings have been proposed to support the analysis of word meaning shifts during time and to study the evolution of languages. Different approaches have been proposed to generate vector representations of words that embed their meaning during a specific time interval. However, the training process used in these approaches is complex, may be inefficient or it may require large text corpora. As a consequence, these approaches may be difficult to apply in resource-scarce domains or by scientists with limited in-depth knowledge of embedding models. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic to train temporal word embeddings based on the Word2vec model. The heuristic consists in using atemporal vectors as a reference, i.e., as a compass, when training the representations specific to a given time interval. The use of the compass simplifies the training process and makes it more efficient. Experiments conducted using stateof-the-art datasets and methodologies suggest that our approach outperforms or equals comparable approaches while being more robust in terms of the required corpus size.},

We philosophers wrestle with the exact same problems the Pre-Socratics wrestled with. Even more outrageous than this claim, though, is the blatant denial of its obvious truth by many practicing philosophers. The No-Progress view is explored and argued for here. Its denial is diagnosed as a form of anosognosia, a mental condition where the affected person denies there is any problem. The theories of two eminent philosophers supporting the No-Progress view are also examined. The final section offers an explanation for philosophy's inability to solve any philosophical problem, ever. The paper closes with some reflections on philosophy's future.},

We examine the spread of academic achievements of first-year undergraduate students through friendship and study assistance networks, applying stochastic actor-oriented modeling. We show that informal social connections transmit performance while instrumental connections do not. The results highlight the importance of friendship in educational environments and contribute to debates on the behavior spread in social networks.},

  abstract = {In this work, we introduce EdgeMaps as a new method for integrating the visualization of explicit and implicit data relations. Explicit relations are specific connections between entities already present in a given dataset, while implicit relations are derived from multidimensional data based on shared properties and similarity measures. Many datasets include both types of relations, which are often difficult to represent together in information visualizations. Node-link diagrams typically focus on explicit data connections, while not incorporating implicit similarities between entities. Multi-dimensional scaling considers similarities between items, however, explicit links between nodes are not displayed. In contrast, EdgeMaps visualize both implicit and explicit relations by combining and complementing spatialization and graph drawing techniques. As a case study for this approach we chose a dataset of philosophers, their interests, influences, and birthdates. By introducing the limitation of activating only one node at a time, interesting visual patterns emerge that resemble the aesthetics of fireworks and waves. We argue that the interactive exploration of these patterns may allow the viewer to grasp the structure of a graph better than complex node-link visualizations.},

  abstract = {Ecologically unequal exchange theory posits asymmetric net flows of biophysical resources from poorer to richer countries. To date, empirical evidence to support this theoretical notion as a systemic aspect of the global economy is largely lacking. Through environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output modelling, we provide empirical evidence for ecologically unequal exchange as a persistent feature of the global economy from 1990 to 2015. We identify the regions of origin and final consumption for four resource groups: materials, energy, land, and labor. By comparing the monetary exchange value of resources embodied in trade, we find significant international disparities in how resource provision is compensated. Value added per ton of raw material embodied in exports is 11 times higher in high-income countries than in those with the lowest income, and 28 times higher per unit of embodied labor. With the exception of embodied land for China and India, all other world regions serve as net exporters of all types of embodied resources to high-income countries across the 1990--2015 time period. On aggregate, ecologically unequal exchange allows high-income countries to si\- multaneously appropriate resources and to generate a monetary surplus through international trade. This has far-reaching implications for global sustainability and for the economic growth prospects of nations.},

I then use this representation to present a typology of operations that could relate two pieces of academic work. I illustrate the various types of relationships with examples from medicine, physics, psychology, history and philosophy of science, machine learning, education, and neuroscience. The resulting typology not only gives insights into the relationships that might exist between static publications, but also the rich process whereby an ongoing research project evolves through interactions with the research literature.},

The model makes the idealizing assumption that all agents always have access to all other agents' belief states. We draw on resources from network epistemology to do away with this assumption. In the model to be proposed, we impose an explicit communication network on a community, due to which each agent has access to the beliefs of only a selection of other agents. A much-discussed result from network epistemology shows that densely connected communication networks are not always preferable to sparser networks. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether there are any noteworthy network effects in a version of the bounded confidence model augmented with communication networks, and in particular whether the aforementioned result from network epistemology can be replicated in that version.},

  abstract = {In Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT ), designing efficient algorithms to compute Nash equilibria poses considerable challenges. We make progress in the field and shed new light on the intersection between Algorithmic Game Theory and Integer Programming. We introduce ZERO Regrets, a general cutting plane algorithm to compute, enumerate, and select Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE s) in Integer Programming Games, a class of simultaneous and non-cooperative games. We present a theoretical foundation for our algorithmic reasoning and provide a polyhedral characterization of the convex hull of the Pure Nash Equilibria. We introduce the concept of equilibrium inequality, and devise an equilibrium separation oracle to separate non-equilibrium strategies from PNE s. We test ZERO Regrets on two paradigmatic classes of games: the Knapsack Game and the Network Formation Game, a well-studied game in AGT . Our algorithm successfully solves relevant instances of both games and shows promising applications for equilibria selection.},

The aim of this article is to show that these authors are right in assuming that results of computer simulations are to be trusted when computer simulations are reliable processes. After a short reconstruction of the problem of epistemic opacity, the article elaborates extensively on computational reliabilism, a specified form of process reliabilism with computer simulations located at the center. The article ends with a discussion of four sources for computational reliabilism, namely, verification and validation, robustness analysis for computer simulations, a history of (un)successful implementations, and the role of expert knowledge in simulations.},

  abstract = {The use of black box algorithms in medicine has raised scholarly concerns due to their opaqueness and lack of trustworthiness. Concerns about potential bias, accountability and responsibility, patient autonomy and compromised trust transpire with black box algorithms. These worries connect epistemic concerns with normative issues. In this paper, we outline that black box algorithms are less problematic for epistemic reasons than many scholars seem to believe. By outlining that more transparency in algorithms is not always necessary, and by explaining that computational processes are indeed methodologically opaque to humans, we argue that the reliability of algorithms provides reasons for trusting the outcomes of medical artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, we explain how computational reliabilism, which does not require transparency and supports the reliability of algorithms, justifies the belief that results of medical AI are to be trusted. We also argue that several ethical concerns remain with black box algorithms, even when the results are trustworthy. Having justified knowledge from reliable indicators is, therefore, necessary but not sufficient for normatively justifying physicians to act. This means that deliberation about the results of reliable algorithms is required to find out what is a desirable action. Thus understood, we argue that such challenges should not dismiss the use of black box algorithms altogether but should inform the way in which these algorithms are designed and implemented. When physicians are trained to acquire the necessary skills and expertise, and collaborate with medical informatics and data scientists, black box algorithms can contribute to improving medical care.},

  abstract = {As the field of neuroimaging grows, it can be difficult for scientists within the field to gain and maintain a detailed understanding of its ever-changing landscape. While collaboration and citation networks highlight important contributions within the field, the roles of and relations among specific areas of study can remain quite opaque. Here, we apply techniques from network science to map the landscape of neuroimaging research documented in the journal NeuroImage over the past decade. We create a network in which nodes represent research topics, and edges give the degree to which these topics tend to be covered in tandem. The network displays small-world architecture, with communities characterized by common imaging modalities and medical applications, and with hubs that integrate these distinct subfields. Using node-level analysis, we quantify the structural roles of individual topics within the neuroimaging landscape, and find high levels of clustering within the structural MRI subfield as well as increasing participation among topics related to psychiatry. The overall prevalence of a topic is unrelated to the prevalence of its neighbors, but the degree to which a topic becomes more or less popular over time is strongly related to changes in the prevalence of its neighbors. Finally, we incorporate data from PNAS to investigate whether it serves as a trend-setter for topics' use within NeuroImage. We find that popularity trends are correlated across the two journals, and that changes in popularity tend to occur earlier within PNAS among growing topics. Broadly, this work presents a cohesive model for understanding the emergent relationships and dynamics of research topics within NeuroImage.},

  abstract = {Playing games in which communication is a key part of game play with or against human players is a challenge for AI research. Agents that should play such games need to reason beyond purely maximizing their score to account for how the human players expect to communicate. One important aspect of this expectation is the notion of intentionality, or goal-directedness, which was defined as choice plus commitment by Cohen and Levesque. They also note that intentionality is tightly linked with reasoning about beliefs, since, in order to determine how to achieve a goal, an agent has to reason about what they know and how their actions might affect the world. In this document, I first present AI agents that play the cooperative card game Hanabi with human players to study how the agents' goal-directed behavior is understood by them. These agents first choose what they want to happen in the game, and then commit to that goal by performing the corresponding action. However, the goals used by the agents are all focused on short-term effects on the game state, and therefore no longer-term commitment strategy is needed. On the basis of the performance of these agents, though, I then describe a general agent design with a model of intentionality that utilizes a theory of mind to play games with communicative actions. The agents use Dynamic Epistemic Logic as a representation of the beliefs of other players to be able to plan their communicative actions as well as interpret communication they receives from other players. As the second application domain I present features deception and lying, I developed a notion of belief quality to account for the uncertainty of information that is provided by other players. The agents use this measure of belief quality to choose a goal corresponding to what they believe that they can convince other players of. Belief quality as a measure of how well a goal can be achieved is also used by the agents to determine how long they should stay committed to a plan, and when they should adopt a new one. I then present how these agents can play the social deduction game One Night Ultimate Werewolf and the results of two experiments for this application. In the first, different agent types played the game against each other, which revealed that different levels of commitment have an effect on the agents win rate. In the second experiment, human players played with the agents, and were asked to rate their experience. As hypothesized, how committed agents were to their goals had an effect on the participants' perception of the agents. Finally, I will shortly discuss how the insights gained from my work can foster future work, by applying the same principles to other domain.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that, in the cognitive and neural sciences, there are both computational and mechanistic explanations. We ask how computational explanations can integrate into the mechanistic hierarchy. The problem stems from the fact that implementation and mechanistic relations have different forms. The implementation relation, from the states of an abstract computational system (e.g., an automaton) to the physical, implementing states is a homomorphism mapping relation. The mechanistic relation, however, is that of part/whole; the explaining features in a mechanistic explanation are the components of the explanandum phenomenon and their causal organization. Moreover, each component in one level of mechanism is constituted and explained by components of an underlying level of mechanism. Hence, it seems, computational variables and functions cannot be mechanistically explained by the medium-dependent states and properties that implement them. How then, do the computational and the implementational integrate to create the mechanistic hierarchy? After explicating the general problem (Sect.~2), we further demonstrate it through a concrete example, of reinforcement learning, in the cognitive and neural sciences (Sects.~3 and 4). We then examine two possible solutions (Sect.~5). On one solution, the mechanistic hierarchy embeds at the same levels computational and implementational properties. This picture fits with the view that computational explanations are mechanistic sketches. On the other solution, there are two separate hierarchies, one computational and another implementational, which are related by the implementation relation. This picture fits with the view that computational explanations are functional and autonomous explanations. It is less clear how these solutions fit with the view that computational explanations are full-fledged mechanistic explanations. Finally, we argue that both pictures are consistent with the reinforcement learning example, but that scientific practice does not align with the view that computational models are merely mechanistic sketches (Sect.~6).},

  abstract = {How does the machine classify styles in art? And how does it relate to art historians' methods for analyzing style? Several studies have shown the ability of the machine to learn and predict style categories, such as Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionism, etc., from images of paintings. This implies that the machine can learn an internal representation encoding discriminative features through its visual analysis. However, such a representation is not necessarily interpretable. We conducted a comprehensive study of several of the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks applied to the task of style classification on 77K images of paintings, and analyzed the learned representation through correlation analysis with concepts derived from art history. Surprisingly, the networks could place the works of art in a smooth temporal arrangement mainly based on learning style labels, without any a priori knowledge of time of creation, the historical time and context of styles, or relations between styles. The learned representations showed that there are few underlying factors that explain the visual variations of style in art. Some of these factors were found to correlate with style patterns suggested by Heinrich W{\textbackslash}"olfflin (1846-1945). The learned representations also consistently highlighted certain artists as the extreme distinctive representative of their styles, which quantitatively confirms art historian observations.},

Further, I argue that interactive theorem provers can continue to be useful tools for historians of philosophy in the future; this claim is defended through a more conceptual analysis of what historians of philosophy do that identifies argument reconstruction as a core activity of such practitioners. It is then shown that interactive theorem provers can assist in this core practice by a description of what interactive theorem provers are and can do.

Integration (greater dependence on counterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting cascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are better insured against one another's failures. Integration also faces trade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less sensitivity to own investments. Finally, we illustrate the model with data on European debt cross-holdings.

  abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based model of team reasoning in a social dilemma game. Starting from the conundrum of empirically high levels of cooperation in dilemma games, contradicting traditional utility maximisation assumptions of game theory, Bacharach (1999, 2006) developed a theory of team reasoning. The idea behind team reasoning is that agents do not try to maximise their own utility but make choices as part of a team. This paper presents a model of preference convergence, mirroring adaptation dynamics of team reasoning. It describes an agent-based model simulating a repeated public goods game between a designated set of agents, a team. In the model agents have a probability to choose cooperation or defection, adjusting this preferences in the face of the revealed preferences of other players. The model is a classic binary choice model mapping an individual's preference for cooperation onto the binary behaviour choice of coop\- eration and defection. Preferences are updated in reaction to the behaviour choices of the team. Starting from simple stated preferences, the model implements a reframing of utility max\- imisation as applying to a group rather than an individual, modelling the importance of social interaction for individual preferences and the dependency of choice on social context. Results show that team reasoning, as implemented here, can explain high levels of cooperation found in the real world resulting from a wide range of settings. It also shows that team reasoning, as implemented here, is not a `sucker' strategy except when adaptation rates are very slow. This paper demonstrates how agent-based models can be used to examine the role of social contexts for individual decision making.},

  abstract = {Recent work has proposed the linear representation hypothesis: that language models perform computation by manipulating one-dimensional representations of concepts ("features") in activation space. In contrast, we explore whether some language model representations may be inherently multi-dimensional. We begin by developing a rigorous definition of irreducible multi-dimensional features based on whether they can be decomposed into either independent or non-co-occurring lower-dimensional features. Motivated by these definitions, we design a scalable method that uses sparse autoencoders to automatically find multi-dimensional features in GPT-2 and Mistral 7B. These auto-discovered features include strikingly interpretable examples, e.g. circular features representing days of the week and months of the year. We identify tasks where these exact circles are used to solve computational problems involving modular arithmetic in days of the week and months of the year. Finally, we provide evidence that these circular features are indeed the fundamental unit of computation in these tasks with intervention experiments on Mistral 7B and Llama 3 8B, and we find further circular representations by breaking down the hidden states for these tasks into interpretable components.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term ``generative'' is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both ``inductive'' and ``deductive'' science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling provides a powerful way to address certain enduring---and especially interdisciplinary---questions. It allows one to subject certain core theories---such as neoclassical microeconomics---to important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give rise---or ``map up''---to macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based (``bottom up'') models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theoretical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent-based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social science---some related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since ``emergence'' figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible. {\copyright} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The lecture distinguishes between explanation and prediction as modeling goals, and offers sixteen reasons other than prediction to build a model. It also challenges the common assumption that scientific theories arise from and 'summarize' data, when often, theories precede and guide data collection; without theory, in other words, it is not clear what data to collect. Among other things, it also argues that the modeling enterprise enforces habits of mind essential to freedom.  It is based on the author's 2008 Bastille Day keynote address to the Second World Congress on Social Simulation, George Mason University, and earlier addresses at the Institute of Medicine, the University of Michigan, and the Santa Fe Institute.},

To connect dynamics and function in systems with these higher-order interactions, network scientists have generalised random-walk models to hypergraphs and studied the multibody effects on flow-based centrality measures. Mapping the large-scale structure of those flows requires effective community detection methods applied to cogent network representations. For different hypergraph data and research questions, which combination of random-walk model and network representation is best? We define unipartite, bipartite, and multilayer network representations of hypergraph flows and explore how they and the underlying random-walk model change the number, size, depth, and overlap of identified multilevel communities. These results help researchers choose the appropriate modelling approach when mapping flows on hypergraphs.},

It is based on the idea that if there are several independent ways of measuring, detecting or deriving something, then we are justified in believing that it is real. I also consider several possible objections to robustness-based entity realism, discuss its relationship to ontic structural realism, and show how it has the potential to provide a novel response to the pessimistic induction argument.},

Tens of such techniques have been proposed, aiming to address a wide set of requirements, such as ability to show the high-dimensional data structure, distance or neighborhood preservation, computational scalability, stability to data noise and/or outliers, and practical ease of use. However, it is far from clear for practitioners how to choose the best technique for a given use context. We present a survey of a wide body of projection techniques that helps answering this question. For this, we characterize the input data space, projection techniques, and the quality of projections, by several quantitative metrics. We sample these three spaces according to these metrics, aiming at good coverage with bounded effort. We describe our measurements and outline observed dependencies of the measured variables. Based on these results, we draw several conclusions that help comparing projection techniques, explain their results for different types of data, and ultimately help practitioners when choosing a projection for a given context. Our methodology, datasets, projection implementations, metrics, visualizations, and results are publicly open, so interested stakeholders can examine and/or extend this benchmark.},

  abstract = {The driver for this study is the wide-ranging published values of the CO2 atmospheric residence time (RT), {$\tau$}, with the values differing by more than an order of magnitude, where the significance of the difference relates to decisions on whether (1) to attempt control of combustion-sourced (anthropogenic) CO2 emissions, if {$\tau$} {$>$} 100 years, or (2) not to attempt control, if {$\tau$} {$\sim$} 10 years. This given difference is particularly evident in the IPCC First 1990 Climate Change Report where, in the opening policymakers summary of the report, the RT is stated to be in the range of 50-200 years, and (largely) on the basis of that, it was also concluded in the report and from subsequent related studies that the current rising level of CO2 was due to combustion of fossil fuels, thus carrying the, now widely accepted, rider that CO2 emissions from combustion should therefore be curbed. However, the actual data in the text of the IPCC report separately states a value of 4 years. The differential of these two times is then clearly identified in the relevant supporting documents of the report as being, separately (1) a long-term ({$\sim$}100 years) adjustment or response time to accommodate imbalance increases in CO2 emissions from all sources and (2) the actual RT in the atmosphere of {$\sim$}4 years. As a check on that differentiation and its alternative outcome, the definition and determination of RT thus defined the need for and focus of this study. In this study, using the combustion/chemical-engineering perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) mixing structure or 0D box for the model basis, as an alternative to the more commonly used global circulation models (GCMs), to define and determine the RT in the atmosphere and then using data from the IPCC and other sources for model validation and numerical determination, the data (1) support the validity of the PSR model application in this context and, (2) from the analysis, provide (quasi-equilibrium) RTs for CO2 of {$\sim$}5 years carrying C12 and {$\sim$}16 years carrying C14, with both values essentially in agreement with the IPCC short-term (4 year) value and, separately, in agreement with most other data sources, notably, a 1998 listing by Segalstad of 36 other published values, also in the range of 5-15 years. Additionally, the analytical results also then support the IPCC analysis and data on the longer ``adjustment time'' ({$\sim$}100 years) governing the long-term rising ``quasi-equilibrium'' concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. For principal verification of the adopted PSR model, the data source used was the outcome of the injection of excess 14CO2 into the atmosphere during the A-bomb tests in the 1950s/1960s, which generated an initial increase of approximately 1000\% above the normal value and which then declined substantially exponentially with time, with {$\tau$} = 16 years, in accordance with the (unsteady-state) prediction from and jointly providing validation for the PSR analysis. With the short (5-15 year) RT results shown to be in quasi-equilibrium, this then supports the (independently based) conclusion that the long-term ({$\sim$}100 year) rising atmospheric CO2 concentration is not from anthropogenic sources but, in accordance with conclusions from other studies, is most likely the outcome of the rising atmospheric temperature, which is due to other natural factors. This further supports the conclusion that global warming is not anthropogenically driven as an outcome of combustion. The economic and political significance of that conclusion will be self-evident.}

The majority of the literature on reward processing has used monetary incentives to elicit reward-related activity, yet social incentives may be particularly important due to their powerful ability to shape behavior. Findings from studies comparing social and monetary rewards have identified both overlapping and distinct responses. In order to explore whether reward processing is domain general or category specific (i.e., the same or different across reward types), the present study recorded ERPs from early adolescents (ages 12--13) and emerging adults (ages 18--25) while they completed social and monetary reward tasks. Temporospatial principal components analysis revealed morphologically similar reward positivities (RewPs) in the social and monetary reward tasks in each age group. In early adolescents, no significant difference was found between the magnitude of the RewP to social and monetary rewards. In emerging adults, however, the RewP to monetary rewards was significantly larger than the RewP to social rewards. Additionally, responses to feedback between the two tasks were not significantly correlated in either age group. These results suggest that both domain-general and category-specific processes underlie neural responses to rewards and that the relative incentive value of different types of rewards may change across development. Findings from this study have important implications for understanding the role that neural response to rewards plays in the development of psychopathology during adolescence.},

This important and controversial book will be of interest to students of Roman society and history, art historians, numismatists, and all those interested in the dynamics between those in power and those not.},

On the other hand, we create retweet networks, detect communities and monitor their evolution through time. This combined approach is applied to three years of Slovenian Twitter data. We report a number of interesting results. Hate speech is dominated by offensive tweets, related to political and ideological issues. The share of unacceptable tweets is moderately increasing with time, from the initial 20\% to 30\% by the end of 2020. Unacceptable tweets are retweeted significantly more often than acceptable tweets. About 60\% of unacceptable tweets are produced by a single right-wing community of only moderate size. Institutional Twitter accounts and media accounts post significantly less unacceptable tweets than individual accounts. However, the main sources of unacceptable tweets are anonymous accounts, and accounts that were suspended or closed during the last three years.},

  abstract = {In this study we explore the disciplinary diversity present within subject specialties in the social sciences and humanities. Subject specialties are operationalized as textually coherent clusters of documents. We apply topic modelling to textual information on the individual document level (titles and abstracts) to cluster a multilingual set of roughly 45,000 documents into subject specialties. The dataset includes the metadata of journal articles, conference proceedings, book chapters, and monographs. We make use of two indicators, namely, the organizational affiliation based on the departmental address of the authors and the cognitive orientation based on the disciplinary classifications at the publication level. First, we study the disciplinary diversity of the clusters by calculating a Hill-type diversity index. We draw an overall picture of the distribution of subject specialties over diversity scores and contrast the two indicators with each other. The goal is to discover whether some subject specialties are inherently multi- or interdisciplinary in nature, and whether the different indicators are telling a well-aligned, similar story. Second, for each cluster of documents we calculate the dominance, i.e. the relative size of the largest discipline. This proxy of disciplinary concentration gives an idea of the extent to which a specialty is disciplined. The results show that all subject specialties analyzed serve as interdisciplinary trading grounds, with outliers in both directions of the disciplinary-interdisciplinary continuum. For a large share of specialties, the dominant cognitive and organizational disciplinary classification were found to be well aligned. We present a typology of subject specialties by contrasting the organizational and cognitive diversity scores.},

  abstract = {Many philosophers claim that the neurocomputational framework of predictive processing entails a globally inferentialist and representationalist view of cognition. Here, I contend that this is not correct. I argue that, given the theoretical commitments these philosophers endorse, no structure within predictive processing systems can be rightfully identified as a representational vehicle. To do so, I first examine some of the theoretical commitments these philosophers share, and show that these commitments provide a set of necessary conditions the satisfaction of which allows us to identify representational vehicles. Having done so, I introduce a predictive processing system capable of active inference, in the form of a simple robotic ``brain''. I examine it thoroughly, and show that, given the necessary conditions highlighted above, none of its components qualifies as a representational vehicle. I then consider and allay some worries my claim could raise. I consider whether the anti-representationalist verdict thus obtained could be generalized, and provide some reasons favoring a positive answer. I further consider whether my arguments here could be blocked by allowing the same representational vehicle to possess multiple contents, and whether my arguments entail some extreme form of revisionism, answering in the negative in both cases. A quick conclusion follows.},

Here, scientific realism is defined as the view that our current successful scientific theories are mostly approximately true, and pessimistic meta-induction is the argument that projects the occurrence of past refutations of successful theories to the present concluding that many or most current successful scientific theories are false. The defense starts with the observation that at least 80\% of all scientific work ever done has been done since 1950, proceeds with the claim that practically all of our most successful theories were entirely stable during that period of time, and concludes that the projection of refutations of successful theories to the present is unsound. In addition to this defense, the paper offers a framework through which scientific realism can be compared with two types of anti-realism. The framework is also of help to examine the relationships between these three positions and the three main arguments offered respectively in their support (No-miracle argument, pessimistic meta-induction, underdetermination).},

The proposed methods are at once statistically rigorous and computationally efficient, because they are based on the general belief updating framework of Bissiri et al. (2016) to loss based inference, but compute by adapting the stable fitting methods of Wood et al. (2016). We show how the pinball loss is statistically suboptimal relative to a novel smooth generalisation, which also gives access to fast estimation methods. Further, we provide a novel calibration method for efficiently selecting the 'learning rate' balancing the loss with the smoothing priors during inference, thereby obtaining reliable quantile uncertainty estimates. Our work was motivated by a probabilistic electricity load forecasting application, used here to demonstrate the proposed approach. The methods described here are implemented by the qgam R package, available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).},

  abstract = {Ecological resilience refers to the ability of a system to retain its state when subject to state variables perturbations or parameter changes. While understanding and quantifying resilience is crucial to anticipate the possible regime shifts, characterizing the influence of the system parameters on resilience is the first step towards controlling the system to avoid undesirable critical transitions. In this paper, we apply tools of qualitative theory of differential equations to study the resilience of competing populations as modeled by the classical Lotka-Volterra system. Within the high interspecific competition regime, such model exhibits bistability, and the boundary between the basins of attraction corresponding to exclusive survival of each population is the stable manifold of a saddle-point. Studying such manifold and its behavior in terms of the model parameters, we characterized the populations resilience: while increasing competitiveness leads to higher resilience, it is not always the case with respect to reproduction. Within a pioneering context where both populations initiate with few individuals, increasing reproduction leads to an increase in resilience; however, within an environment previously dominated by one population and then invaded by the other, an increase in resilience is obtained by decreasing the reproduction rate.

  abstract = {Ecological resilience refers to the ability of a system to retain its state when subject to state variables perturbations or parameter changes. While understanding and quantifying resilience is crucial to anticipate the possible regime shifts, characterizing the influence of the system parameters on resilience is the first step towards controlling the system to avoid undesirable critical transitions. In this paper, we apply tools of qualitative theory of differential equations to study the resilience of competing populations as modeled by the classical Lotka-Volterra system. Within the high interspecific competition regime, such model exhibits bistability, and the boundary between the basins of attraction corresponding to exclusive survival of each population is the stable manifold of a saddle-point. Studying such manifold and its behavior in terms of the model parameters, we characterized the populations resilience: while increasing competitiveness leads to higher resilience, it is not always the case with respect to reproduction. Within a pioneering context where both populations initiate with few individuals, increasing reproduction leads to an increase in resilience; however, within an environment previously dominated by one population and then invaded by the other, an increase in resilience is obtained by decreasing the reproduction rate. Besides providing interesting insights for the dynamics of competing population, this work brings near to each other the theoretical concepts of ecological resilience and the mathematical methods of differential equations and stimulates the development and application of new mathematical tools for ecological resilience.},

  abstract = {Liberalism ordinarily requires authorities to provide a full public account of their actions so that citizens can critically evaluate those actions for themselves, but in times of life-threatening emergency, liberalism sometimes evinces a willingness to place unquestioning faith in executives who promise to deliver it from such evil. In doing so, liberalism violates its moral and epistemological commitment to "make public use of one's reason in all matters." This article uses the framework provided by Carl Schmitt's concept of political theology to analyze the reluctance of liberals to ask questions of the executive in times of danger and uncertainty. That framework helps explain how both the content and the structure of liberal thought can shift in a theological (and specifically theistic) direction when faced with an emergency. This article demonstrates that the quasi-religious rhetoric sometimes used to justify expansions of executive power in practice has precedents in the theories of John Locke, William Blackstone, and Alexander Hamilton. Analysis of their writings suggests that the use of quasi-theistic language in discussions of emergency powers can have the effect of insulating "godlike" executives from the kind of scrutiny and criticism that liberalism usually promotes.},

The model provides an innovative approach to establishing the optimal distribution of cognitive labor in scientific communities, using an epistemic landscape. In the paper, we provide a critical examination of ELM. First, we show that the computing mechanism for ELM is correct insofar as we are able to replicate the results using another programming language. Second, we show that small changes in the rules that determine the behavior of individual agents can lead to important changes in simulation results. Accordingly, we claim that ELM results are robust with respect to the computing mechanism, but not necessarily across parameter space. We conclude by reflecting on the possible lessons to be gained from ELM as a class of simulations or cluster of models.},

  abstract = {This paper describes algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the beta-divergence (beta-NMF). The beta-divergence is a family of cost functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).},

  abstract = {University faculty hiring networks are known to be hierarchical, and to exacerbate various types of inequity. Still, a detailed, historical understanding of hiring dynamics lacks in many academic fields. We focus on the field of mathematics, analyzing over 120,000 records from 150 institutions over seven decades to elucidate the temporal dynamics of faculty hiring at the individual and departmental levels. We demonstrate that the disparity between the number of mathematics Ph.D.s awarded and the number of faculty positions filled has grown over time. Even institutions with the best records of faculty placement have experienced a temporal decline in the probability of their graduates obtaining a faculty position. By quantifying the mathematical prestige of each department with a network statistic, authority centrality, we find a power law relation between the prestige of one's Ph.D. institution and the probability of obtaining a faculty position. Moreover, both time and female gender are associated with a decreased probability of obtaining a faculty position. On the departmental level, there is a group of 14 elite departments that dominate the authority centrality of the entire network consistently between 1950 and 2019. Strikingly, one department within this elite group increases its centrality scores consistently at the expense of others, which hints at the possibility for a department to improve its prestige. Our results highlight the challenges of transitioning from Ph.D. holder to faculty member in mathematics, and we hope our analysis will support efforts to understand and improve faculty hiring in mathematics.},

The damping factor is comparable to that observed in the O2 flash yield oscillation and therefore explained by misses in Photosystem II. (2) On the average and after a steady state is reached, each flash (i.e. each reduction of Q) induces the uptake of 2H+ from outside the chloroplasts. (3) Flash induced proton release inside the chloroplast membrane shows a strong damped binary oscillation with maximum release occurring also after the 2nd, 4th, etc. flashes. (4) This phenomenon is correlated with the earlier reported binary oscillations of electron transport [2] and shows that both electrons and protons are transported in pairs between the photosystems. (5) In two sequential flashes 4H+ from the outside of the thylakoid and 2e- from water are accumulated at a binding site B. Subsequently, the two electrons are transferred to non-protonated acceptors in Photosystem I (probably plastocyanin and cytochrome f) and the 4H+ are released inside the thylakoid. (6) It is concluded that a primary proton transporting site and/or energy conserving step located between the photosystems is being observed.},

The most challenging aspect of using this approach in the context of operational radar applications is to be able to perform a fast and accurate search for similar spatiotemporal precipitation patterns in a large archive of historical records. In this context, sequential pairwise search is too slow and computationally expensive. Here, we propose an architecture to significantly speed up spatiotemporal analog retrieval by combining nonlinear geometric dimensionality reduction (UMAP) with the fastest known Euclidean search algorithm for time series (MASS) to find radar analogs in constant time, independently of the desired temporal length to match and the number of extracted analogs. We show that UMAP, combined with a grid search protocol over relevant hyperparameters, can find analog sequences with lower mean square error (MSE) than principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, we show that MASS is 20 times faster than brute force search on the UMAP embedding space. We test the architecture on real dataset and show that it enables precise and fast operational analog ensemble search through more than 2 years of radar archive in less than 3 seconds on a single workstation.},

We provide a study of latent space geometries and extend and build upon previous results on Riemannian metrics. We show how a class of heuristic measures gives more flexibility in finding meaningful, problem-specific distances, and how it can be applied to diverse generator types such as autoregressive generators commonly used in e.g. language and other sequence modeling. We further demonstrate how a diffusion-inspired transformation previously studied in cartography can be used to smooth out latent spaces, stretching them according to a chosen measure. In addition to providing more meaningful distances directly in latent space, this also provides a unique tool for novel kinds of data visualizations. We believe that the proposed methods can be a valuable tool for studying the structure of latent spaces and learned data distributions of generative models.},

Our results suggest that whether and to which extent the degree of connectedness of a scientific community impacts its efficiency is a highly context-dependent matter since different conditions deem strikingly different results. More generally, we argue that simplicity of ABMs may come at a price: the requirement to run extensive robustness analysis before we can specify the adequate target phenomenon of the model.},

  abstract = {Background Depression severity is assessed in numerous research disciplines, ranging from the social sciences to genetics, and used as a dependent variable, predictor, covariate, or to enroll participants. The routine practice is to assess depression severity with one particular depression scale, and draw conclusions about depression in general, relying on the assumption that scales are interchangeable measures of depression. The present paper investigates to which degree 7 common depression scales differ in their item content and generalizability. Methods A content analysis is carried out to determine symptom overlap among the 7 scales via the Jaccard index (0=no overlap, 1=full overlap). Per scale, rates of idiosyncratic symptoms, and rates of specific vs. compound symptoms, are computed. Results The 7 instruments encompass 52 disparate symptoms. Mean overlap among all scales is low (0.36), mean overlap of each scale with all others ranges from 0.27 to 0.40, overlap among individual scales from 0.26 to 0.61. Symptoms feature across a mean of 3 scales, 40\% of the symptoms appear in only a single scale, 12\% across all instruments. Scales differ regarding their rates of idiosyncratic symptoms (0--33\%) and compound symptoms (22--90\%). Limitations Future studies analyzing more and different scales will be required to obtain a better estimate of the number of depression symptoms; the present content analysis was carried out conservatively and likely underestimates heterogeneity across the 7 scales. Conclusion The substantial heterogeneity of the depressive syndrome and low overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a threat to the replicability and generalizability of depression research. Implications and future research opportunities are discussed.},

  abstract = {The last decade has brought reforms to improve methodological practices, with the goal to increase the reliability and replicability of effects. However, explanations of effects remain scarce, and a growing chorus of scholars argues that the replicability crisis has distracted from a crisis of theory. In the same decade, the empirical literature using factor and network models has grown rapidly. I discuss three ways in which this literature falls short of theory building and testing. First, statistical and theoretical models are conflated, leading to invalid inferences such as the existence of psychological constructs based on factor models, or recommendations for clinical interventions based on network models. I demonstrate this inferential gap in a simulation study on statistical equivalence: excellent model fit does little to corroborate a theory, regardless of quality or quantity of data. Second, researchers fail to explicate theories about psychological constructs, but use implicit causal beliefs to guide inferences. These latent theories have led to problematic best practices in psychological research where inferences are drawn based on one specific causal model that is assumed, but not explicated. Third, explicated theories are often weak theories: narrative and imprecise descriptions vulnerable to hidden assumptions and unknowns. They fail to make clear predictions, and it remains unclear whether statistical effects corroborate such theories or not. Weak theories are immune to refutation or revision. I argue that these three challenges to theory building and testing are common and harmful, and impede theory formation, failure, and reform. A renewed focus on theoretical psychology and formal models offers a way forward.},

Applying a validated artificial intelligence classifier to all 1.3 million tweets made by members of Congress since 2009, we observe a 23\% increase in incivility over a decade on Twitter. Further analyses suggest that the rise was partly driven by reinforcement learning in which politicians engaged in greater incivility following positive feedback. Uncivil tweets tended to receive more approval and attention, publicly indexed by large quantities of ``likes'' and ``retweets'' on the platform. Mediational and longitudinal analyses show that the greater this feedback for uncivil tweets, the more uncivil tweets were thereafter. We conclude by discussing how the structure of social media platforms might facilitate this incivility-reinforcing dynamic between politicians and their followers.},

  abstract = {This essay addresses Cartesian duality and how its implicit dialectic might be repaired using physics and information theory. Our agenda is to describe a key distinction in the physical sciences that may provide a foundation for the distinction between mind and matter, and between sentient and intentional systems. From this perspective, it becomes tenable to talk about the physics of sentience and \&lsquo;forces\&rsquo; that underwrite our beliefs (in the sense of probability distributions represented by our internal states), which may ground our mental states and consciousness. We will refer to this view as Markovian monism, which entails two claims: (1) fundamentally, there is only one type of thing and only one type of irreducible property (hence monism). (2) All systems possessing a Markov blanket have properties that are relevant for understanding the mind and consciousness: if such systems have mental properties, then they have them partly by virtue of possessing a Markov blanket (hence Markovian). Markovian monism rests upon the information geometry of random dynamic systems. In brief, the information geometry induced in any system\&mdash;whose internal states can be distinguished from external states\&mdash;must acquire a dual aspect. This dual aspect concerns the (intrinsic) information geometry of the probabilistic evolution of internal states and a separate (extrinsic) information geometry of probabilistic beliefs about external states that are parameterised by internal states. We call these intrinsic (i.e., mechanical, or state-based) and extrinsic (i.e., Markovian, or belief-based) information geometries, respectively. Although these mathematical notions may sound complicated, they are fairly straightforward to handle, and may offer a means through which to frame the origins of consciousness.},

Putty-nosed monkeys display a compositional system of alarm calls with a semantics that is sensitive to the ordering of terms. This sensitivity to the ordering of terms has not been previously modeled with a Lewis-Skyrms signaling game literature. Signaling games are valued for showing how communicative systems can arise with minimal learning tools. Simulation results show that basic (Roth-Erev) reinforcement learning is sufficient for the acquisition of a compositional signaling system sensitive to the ordering of terms.},

Scientism's implicit philosophical roots are argued to lie in naturalism and a trivialized neopositivist concept of science, which underscores the supposed unity of the scientific enterprise. However , in the context of the pandemic, science's disunity is more than ever visible. It is herein asserted that the untimely glimpse into science's inner workings, clashing with the dominant view in popular science, promotes a distorted image of science and hinders people's trust in science. Finally, this article provides wide-ranging recommendations in order to tackle scientism and promote a balanced outlook on science in the fodder consumed by the masses.}

We discuss the importance of considering path dependence, lack of optimization and collective myopia to understand the sometimes counterintuitive outcomes of collective adaptation. We call for a transdisciplinary, quantitative and societally useful social science that can help us to understand our rapidly changing and ever more complex societies, avoid collective disasters and reach the full potential of our ability to organize in adaptive collectives.},

  abstract = {A tumour is a heterogeneous population of cells that competes for limited resources. In the clinic, we typically probe the tumour by biopsy, and then characterize it by the dominant genetic clone. But genotypes are only the first link in the chain of hierarchical events that leads to a specific cell phenotype. The relationship between genotype and phenotype is not simple, and the so-called genotype to phenotype map is poorly understood. Many genotypes can produce the same phenotype, so genetic heterogeneity may not translate directly to phenotypic heterogeneity. We therefore choose to focus on the functional endpoint, the phenotype as defined by a collection of cellular traits (e.g. proliferative and migratory ability). Here, we will examine how phenotypic heterogeneity evolves in space and time and how the way in which phenotypes are inherited will drive this evolution. A tumour can be thought of as an ecosystem, which critically means that we cannot just consider it as a collection of mutated cells but more as a complex system of many interacting cellular and microenvironmental elements. At its simplest, a growing tumour with increased proliferation capacity must compete for space as a limited resource. Hypercellularity leads to a contact-inhibited core with a competitive proliferating rim. Evolution and selection occurs, and an individual cell's capacity to survive and propagate is determined by its combination of traits and interaction with the environment. With heterogeneity in phenotypes, the clone that will dominate is not always obvious as there are both local interactions and global pressures. Several combinations of phenotypes can coexist, changing the fitness of the whole. To understand some aspects of heterogeneity in a growing tumour, we build an off-lattice agent-based model consisting of individual cells with assigned trait values for proliferation and migration rates. We represent heterogeneity in these traits with frequency distributions and combinations of traits with density maps. How the distributions change over time is dependent on how traits are passed on to progeny cells, which is our main enquiry. We bypass the translation of genetics to behaviour by focusing on the functional end result of inheritance of the phenotype combined with the environmental influence of limited space.},

Philosophers of science favor a metaphysical approach relying on natural kind theorizing, the underlying assumptions of which structure the questions asked. Limitations arise the more metaphysically invested and less attuned to scientific practice these questions are. Other questions - arguably, those that matter most socially and politically - remain unasked, not merely overlooked but systematically ignored and even foreclosed. Race fails as a postulated natural kind because it fails to meet expectations that as a category of classification it furnish an authoritative taxonomy that by depicting fundamental divisions in nature is conducive to fulfilling far-ranging explanatory aims. Racial, ethnic, and other group designations may nonetheless be projectible insofar as they support inductive inferences in biomedicine, but this does not render them any less social. Indeed, the statistical, contingent, accidental, localized, and interest-relative bases of such inferences serve to undercut the dichotomizing of race as either biological reality or social construct and favor the adoption of a pragmatic approach.},

We present the first large-scale test of this theory through the analysis of digital traces of 62,114 Twitter users after the Paris terrorist attacks of November 2015. We found a collective negative emotional response followed by a marked long-term increase in the use of lexical indicators related to solidarity. Expressions of social processes, prosocial behavior, and positive affect were higher in the months after the attacks for the individuals who participated to a higher degree in the collective emotion. Our findings support the conclusion that collective emotions after a disaster are associated with higher solidarity, revealing the social resilience of a community.},

Many studies have investigated the central trade-off between explore--exploit and how individual foragers manage it under various conditions. For foragers in groups, this trade-off can be affected by the social environment, influencing the evolution of individual search strategies. Previous work has shown that when learning socially, explorative search strategies can optimize group search efficiency. However, social learning can cause discrepancies in strategies that benefit the group versus an individual. We model the evolution of explorative and exploitative strategies using L{\'e}vy exponents under different levels of social learning and investigate their effect on individual and group search efficiencies. We show that reliance on social learning can lead to the evolution of mixed groups that are not optimally efficient. Exploiters can have a selective advantage in scrounging findings by explorers, but too many exploiters can diminish group efficiencies. However, greater opportunities for social learning can increase the benefits of explorative strategies. Finally, we show that area-restricted search can help individuals balance exploration and exploitation, and make groups more efficient. Our results demonstrate how exploration and exploitation must be balanced at both individual and collective levels for efficient search.},

We first introduce a network morphogenesis model to reconstruct network structures where homophily can be tuned with a parameter. We show that as homophily increases the emergence of marked topological community structures in the networks raises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent networks and we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps consensus formation. Finally, we introduce a tunable external media pressure and we show that, actually, the combination of homophily and media makes the media effect less effective and leads to strongly polarized opinion clusters.},

The embedding captures global social shifts -- e.g., the women's movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the U.S -- and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time.

After a preliminary presentation of the basic functioning of elementary artificial neural networks, we introduce the motivations and capabilities of word embeddings through one of its pioneering models, word2vec. To assess the remarkable results of the latter, we inspect the nature of its underlying mechanisms, which have been characterized as the implicit factorization of a word-context matrix. We then discuss the ordinary association of the ``distributional hypothesis'' with a ``use theory of meaning,'' often justifying the theoretical basis of word embeddings, and contrast them to the theory of meaning stemming from those mechanisms through the lens of matrix models (such as vector space models and distributional semantic models). Finally, we trace back the principles of their possible consistency through Harris's original distributionalism up to the structuralist conception of language of Saussure and Hjelmslev. Other than giving access to the technical literature and state of the art in the field of natural language processing to non-specialist readers, the paper seeks to reveal the conceptual and philosophical stakes involved in the recent application of new neural network techniques to the computational treatment of language.},

  abstract = {Clustering is one of the most universal approaches for understanding complex data. A pivotal aspect of clustering analysis is quantitatively comparing clusterings; clustering comparison is the basis for many tasks such as clustering evaluation, consensus clustering, and tracking the temporal evolution of clusters. In particular, the extrinsic evaluation of clustering methods requires comparing the uncovered clusterings to planted clusterings or known metadata. Yet, as we demonstrate, existing clustering comparison measures have critical biases which undermine their usefulness, and no measure accommodates both overlapping and hierarchical clusterings. Here we unify the comparison of disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchically structured clusterings by proposing a new element-centric framework: elements are compared based on the relationships induced by the cluster structure, as opposed to the traditional cluster-centric philosophy. We demonstrate that, in contrast to standard clustering similarity measures, our framework does not suffer from critical biases and naturally provides unique insights into how the clusterings differ. We illustrate the strengths of our framework by revealing new insights into the organization of clusters in two applications: the improved classification of schizophrenia based on the overlapping and hierarchical community structure of fMRI brain networks, and the disentanglement of various social homophily factors in Facebook social networks. The universality of clustering suggests far-reaching impact of our framework throughout all areas of science.},

  abstract = {Injunctive social norms are behaviours that one is expected to follow and expects others to follow in a given social situation; they are maintained by the threat of disapproval or punishment and by the process of internalization. Injunctive norms govern all aspects of our social life but the understanding of their effects on individual and group behaviour is currently rather incomplete. Here I develop a general mathematical approach describing the dynamics of injunctive norms in heterogeneous groups. My approach captures various costs and benefits, both material and normative, associated with norm-related behaviours including punishment and disapproval by others. It also allows for errors in decision-making and explicitly accounts for differences between individuals in their values, beliefs about the population state, and sensitivity to the actions of others. In addition, it enables one to study the consequences of mixing populations with different normative values and the effects of persuasive interventions. I describe how interactions of these factors affect individual and group behaviour. As an illustration, I consider policies developed by practitioners to abolish the norms of footbinding and female genital cutting, to decrease college students' drinking, and to increase pro-environmental behaviours. The theory developed here can be used for achieving a better understanding of historical and current social processes as well as for developing practical policies better accounting for human social behaviour.},

  abstract = {This paper examines conceptual issues of the emergence and effects of collective agency. Collective agency seems to challenge the methodological individualist assumption that only individuals can act, but treating group actors, such as parliamentary committees or court chambers, as mere shortcuts for complex interactions among group members raises important theoretical, empirical, and normative issues. First, the paper discusses some fundamental issues of collective agency. We argue that analyses of collective agency must provide generative mechanisms that demonstrate how it arises from the interaction of group members. Second, the paper introduces major approaches to collective agency from analytical philosophy and sociology. They locate the source of collective agency in the formation of collective intentions through the adjustment of group members' attitudes, in the organization of group decision processes, or in the transfer of resources to the group level, which empowers a collective actor to act in its own right. Against this backdrop, this paper offers an integrative concept of collective agency characterized in terms of the degree of autonomy and the level of resources controlled by a collective actor. Third, this paper introduces the contributions to this special issue, which tackle a broad variety of issues, including the formation and consequences of collective intentions in small and unorganized groups, collective agency issues of institutionalized groups and organizations, collective agency of large and unorganized groups without defined memberships, and normative issues of collective agency.},

While organizational independence is a precondition for the autonomy and agency of IOs, International Relations theory cannot yet grasp IO independence in the absence of institutional agents like secretariats. Drawing on collective actor theories with a strong micro-foundation from philosophy and sociology, this article demonstrates how organizational rules and procedures gradually shape organizational processes and produce collective effects that do not arise from the aggregation of member state activities. Member-dominated IOs can produce collective beliefs about relevant parts of the outside world that differ from the aggregated beliefs of member states. They can comprise institutionalized organizational goals and criteria that indicate collective intentions of organizational action and differ from the aggregate preferences of member states. They can comprise decision-making procedures that foster organizational decisions according to collective beliefs and intentions and reduce or abolish the relevance of bargaining and preference aggregation. Finally, they can act in ways that do not immediately rely on implementation action by the member states or by other lower-level actors. I conclude that analyzing the sources of independence of member-dominated IOs from their members sheds light on the nature and effects of IOs as group actors.},

Existing rationalist and constructivist accounts attribute IO agency to the influence of intra-organizational agents. Drawing on general conceptions of corporate agency in International Relations, sociology, and philosophy, we elucidate how IOs can develop corporate agency, even if the member states prepare and adopt all organizational decisions themselves. In line with recent studies on international political authority, we replace the IO-as-bureaucracy model with the more comprehensive concept of IOs-as-governors. To establish the micro-foundations of IO agency, we adopt a bottom-up perspective and outline how, and under which conditions, IO agency arises from the interaction of constituent actors. Irrespective of any specific institutional design, IOs become actors in their own right whenever they gain action capability and autonomy. They acquire action capability whenever their members pool governance resources like the right to regulate certain activities or to manage common funds and authorize IOs to deploy these resources. IOs gain autonomy whenever they affect organizational decisions. Both dimensions of IO agency are variable and open to empirical enquiry. To illustrate our argument, we refer to the United Nations Security Council and other IOs with member-driven decision processes.},

Unlike traditional international organizations (IOs), it lacks the formal status of an IO, comprises only a limited secretariat with predominantly servicing functions, and is not even denominated as an organization. We argue that it has nevertheless become an international actor, mainly due to activities of its Conference of the Parties and several specialized organizational schemes.               Theoretically               , we develop an analytical framework that shows how even heavily member-dominated IOs can become international actors and what this means for global environmental governance. IOs gain the capability to influence international politics by their own action if authorized to make decisions with external effects. They gain autonomy if organizational rules and procedures shape organizational decision-making and create specific organizational rationales.               Empirically               , we demonstrate that the organizational component of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement has acquired both considerable action capability and autonomy. It is authorized to flesh out the skeletal provisions of the constituent treaties through far-reaching COP decisions and to decide continuously in several specialized organizational schemes, especially on climate funding, cooperation mechanisms, and compliance management. Organizational decisions are heavily influenced by autonomy-creating organizational factors, such as path dependence, fundamental organizational norms and dense sets of decision criteria. We conclude that this organization, and the organizational components of other multilateral environmental agreements, point at important organizational effects, which merit further attention.},

We compare our method to several conventional tweet representation methods including bag-of-words, term frequency-inverse document frequency, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorization with 3 different clustering algorithms. Our results show that the clustering performance using proposed representation learning scheme significantly outperforms that of conventional methods for all experiments of different number of clusters. In addition, we propose a constraint on the learned representations during the neural network training in order to further enhance the clustering performance. All in all, this study introduces utilization of deep neural network-based architectures, i.e., deep convolutional autoencoders, for learning informative representations of health-related tweets.},

A corpus of metaphors from 1894 to the present was collected and examined. The corpus consisted of all metaphors for mental phenomena used in the 1st issue of Psychological Review in each decade, beginning with the inception of the journal in 1894 and continuing through 1975. These 9 issues yielded 265 mental metaphors that were categorized according to the type of analogical domain from which the comparison was drawn. Results show that the nature of the mental metaphors changed over time. Spatial metaphors and animate-being metaphors predominated in the early stages, then declined in favor of systems metaphors taken from mathematics and the physical sciences. The numbers of mental metaphors varied. Metaphors for mental phenomena were more prevalent in the early and late stages of the corpus than in the middle stages (1935--1955). These patterns are interpreted in terms of conceptual evolution in psychologists' models of the mind. (52 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {One of the main computational and scientific challenges in the modern age is to extract useful information from unstructured texts. Topic models are one popular machine-learning approach which infers the latent topical structure of a collection of documents. Despite their success --- in particular of its most widely used variant called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) --- and numerous applications in sociology, history, and linguistics, topic models are known to suffer from severe conceptual and practical problems, e.g. a lack of justification for the Bayesian priors, discrepancies with statistical properties of real texts, and the inability to properly choose the number of topics. Here we obtain a fresh view on the problem of identifying topical structures by relating it to the problem of finding communities in complex networks. This is achieved by representing text corpora as bipartite networks of documents and words. By adapting existing community-detection methods -- using a stochastic block model (SBM) with non-parametric priors -- we obtain a more versatile and principled framework for topic modeling (e.g., it automatically detects the number of topics and hierarchically clusters both the words and documents). The analysis of artificial and real corpora demonstrates that our SBM approach leads to better topic models than LDA in terms of statistical model selection. More importantly, our work shows how to formally relate methods from community detection and topic modeling, opening the possibility of cross-fertilization between these two fields.},

  abstract = {Monarchy was the dominant form of rule in the pre-modern era and it persists in a handful of countries. We propose a unified theoretical explanation for its rise and decline. Specifically, we argue that monarchy offers an efficient solution to the primordial problem of order where societies are large and citizens isolated from each other and hence have difficulty coordinating. Its efficiency is challenged by other methods of leadership selection when communication costs decline, lowering barriers to citizen coordination. This explains its dominance in the pre-modern world and its subsequent demise. To test this theory, we produce an original dataset that codes monarchies and republics in Europe (back to 1100) and the world (back to 1700). With this dataset, we test a number of observable implications of the theory---centering on territory size, political stability, tenure in office, conflict, and the role of mass communications in the modern era.},

  abstract = {The concepts of adaptation and fitness have such an appeal that they have been used in other scientific domains, including the social sciences. One particular aspect of this theory transfer concerns the so-called fitness landscape models. At first sight, fitness landscapes visualize how an agent, of any kind, relates to its environment, how its position is conditional because of the mutual interaction with other agents, and the potential routes towards improved fitness. The allure of fitness landscapes is first and foremost that it represents a complex story about adaptation and fitness in one coherent image. Different accounts of fitness landscapes in different domains in the social sciences suggest that the properties and functions of fitness landscapes are attributed rather freely. These differences are testimony of the model's versatility. At the same time, one will notice that the different approaches can also create ambiguity about the exact meaning and role of fitness landscapes in the social sciences. This article presents an extensive literature survey of the diverging interpretations and uses of fitness landscapes in the social sciences and discusses the implications in terms of how these models inform scientific inquiry.},

What is the most far-reaching impact of influence, as well as who are the most immediate influencing, and the most influenced by other intellectuals in history? To answer these types of questions, we mined a network of influence among over 12 thousand intellectuals, from YAGO, a pioneering data source of Linked Open Data. We conducted several essential types of social network analysis, concerning connectivity, degree distribution, prestige (influence), and importance (centrality). We studied the diffusion dynamics of influence by analyzing the influence cascades in terms of size, depth and breadth.

Then, we introduce the theory behind UMAP by algebraic topology and category theory. Then, we introduce UMAP as a neighbor embedding method and compare it with t-SNE and LargeVis algorithms. We discuss negative sampling and repulsive forces in UMAP's cost function. DensMAP is then explained for density-preserving embedding. We then introduce parametric UMAP for embedding by deep learning and progressive UMAP for streaming and out-of-sample data embedding.},

  abstract = {Cooperative behavior, which pervades nature, can be significantly enhanced when agents interact in a structured rather than random way; however, the key structural factors that affect cooperation are not well understood. Moreover, the role structure plays with cooperation has largely been studied through observing overall cooperation rather than the underlying components that together shape cooperative behavior. In this paper we address these two problems by first applying evolutionary games to a wide range of networks, where agents play the Prisoner's Dilemma with a three-component stochastic strategy, and then analyzing agent-based simulation results using principal component analysis. With these methods we study the evolution of trust, reciprocity and forgiveness as a function of several structural parameters. This work demonstrates that community structure, represented by network modularity, among all the tested structural parameters, has the most significant impact on the emergence of cooperative behavior, with forgiveness showing the largest sensitivity to community structure. We also show that increased community structure reduces the dispersion of trust and forgiveness, thereby reducing the network-level uncertainties for these two components; graph transitivity and degree also significantly influence the evolutionary dynamics of the population and the diversity of strategies at equilibrium.},

We focus on small floating-point errors because these are most likely to occur, whilst still potentially having a major influence on the outcome of the model. The significance of small floating-point errors in computer models can often be reduced by applying a range of different techniques to different parts of the code. Which technique is most appropriate depends on the specifics of the particular numerical situation under investigation. We illustrate the framework by applying it to six example agent-based models in the literature.},

The main argument supporting this claim is the belief that top cited authors in journal articles and in monographs form two distinct populations. In this article, we compare the rankings of the most cited authors in three SSH disciplines (sociology, philosophy, and history), obtained by counting citations in the journal articles covered in the Web of Science, and a large sample of books and book chapters covered in the book citation index. Contrary to what is often suggested, we show that adding book and book chapter citations to journal citations does not produce significantly different rankings than those obtained solely on the basis of citations in journal articles.},

I call it the prediction-explanation fallacy. The fallacy occurs when researchers use prediction-optimized models for explanatory purposes, without considering the tradeoffs between explanation and prediction. This is a problem for at least two reasons. First, prediction-optimized models are often deliberately biased and unrealistic in order to prevent overfitting, and hence fail to accurately explain the phenomenon of interest. In other cases, they have an exceedingly complex structure that is hard or impossible to interpret, which greatly limits their explanatory value. Second, different predictive models trained on the same or similar data can be biased in different ways, so that multiple models may predict equally well but suggest conflicting explanations of the underlying phenomenon. In this note I introduce the tradeoffs between prediction and explanation in a non-technical fashion, present some illustrative examples from neuroscience, and end by discussing some mitigating factors and methods that can be used to limit or circumvent the problem.},

This is commonly approached by training word embeddings on each corpus, aligning the vector spaces, and looking for words whose cosine distance in the aligned space is large. However, these methods often require extensive filtering of the vocabulary to perform well, and---as we show in this work---result in unstable, and hence less reliable, results. We propose an alternative approach that does not use vector space alignment, and instead considers the neighbors of each word. The method is simple, interpretable and stable. We demonstrate its effectiveness in 9 different setups, considering different corpus splitting criteria (age, gender and profession of tweet authors, time of tweet) and different languages (English, French and Hebrew).},

  abstract = {As a reasonable statistical learning model for curve clustering analysis, the two-layer mixtures of Gaussian process functional regressions (TMGPFR) model has been developed to fit the data of sample curves from a number of independent information sources or stochastic processes. Since the sample curves from a certain stochastic process naturally form a curve cluster, the model selection of TMGPFRs, i.e., the selection of the number of mixtures of Gaussian process functional regressions (MGPFRs) in the upper layer, corresponds to the discovery of the cluster number and structure of the curve data. In fact, this is rather challenging because the conventional model selection criteria, such as BIC and cross-validation, cannot lead to a stable result in practice even with a heavy burden of repetitive computation. In this paper, we improve the original TMGPFR model and propose a Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) annealing learning algorithm for the parameter learning of the improved model with automated model selection. The experimental results of both synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can make correct model selection automatically during parameter learning of the model.},

We demonstrate that how time is conceptualized significantly impacts a cosmology's notion on causality, and hone in on how time is conceptualized differentially in modern physics and evolutionary biology. The former conflates time with space into a single space--time continuum and focuses instead on the movement of matter, while the evolutionary sciences have a tradition to understand time as a given when they~cartography how organisms change across generations over or in time, thereby proving the phenomenon of evolution. The gap becomes more fundamental when we take into account that phenomena studied by chrono-biologists demonstrate that numerous organisms, including humans, have evolved a ``sense'' of time. And~micro-evolutionary/genetic, meso-evolutionary/developmental and macro-evolutionary phenomena including speciation and extinction not only occur by different evolutionary modes and at different rates, they are also timely phenomena that follow different periodicities. This article focusses on delineating the problem by finding its historical roots. We conclude that though time might be an obsolete concept for the physical sciences, it is crucial for the evolutionary sciences where evolution is defined as the change that biological individuals undergo in/over or through time.},

  abstract = {Numerical models are starting to be used for determining the future behaviour of seismic faults and fault networks. Their final goal would be to forecast future large earthquakes. In order to use them for this task, it is necessary to synchronize each model with the current status of the actual fault or fault network it simulates (just as, for example, meteorologists synchronize their models with the atmosphere by incorporating current atmospheric data in them). However, lithospheric dynamics is largely unobservable: important parameters cannot (or can rarely) be measured in Nature. Earthquakes, though, provide indirect but measurable clues of the stress and strain status in the lithosphere, which should be helpful for the synchronization of the models.},

On several examples we show advantages of using non-linear objects for data approximation in comparison to the linear ones. We propose four numerical criteria for comparing linear and non-linear mappings of datasets into the spaces of lower dimension. The examples are taken from comparative political science, from analysis of high-throughput data in molecular biology, from analysis of dynamical systems.},

Previous work has shown that categorizing M\&S as a concentration in an existing, broader disciple is inadequate because it does not provide a uniform basis for research and education across all institutions. This article presents an approach for the classification of M\&S as a scientific discipline and a framework for ensuing analysis. The novelty of the approach lies in its application of machine learning classification to documents containing unstructured text (e.g. publications, funding solicitations) from a variety of established and emerging disciplines related to modeling and simulation. We demonstrate that machine learning classification models can be trained to accurately separate M\&S from related disciplines using the abstracts of well-index research publication repositories. We evaluate the accuracy of our trained classifiers using cross-fold validation. Then, we demonstrate that our trained classifiers can effectively identify a set of previously unseen M\&S funding solicitations and grant proposals. Finally, we use our approach to uncover new funding trends in M\&S and support a uniform basis for education and research.},

After assembling around three million comments from incel-themed Reddit channels, we analyze the temporal dynamics of a data driven rank ordering of the glossary of phrases belonging to an emergent incel lexicon.

Frontier settlement theory suggests that physical topography is a crucial factor shaping the psychological landscape of regions. Hence, we investigated whether topography is associated with regional variation in personality across the United States (n\,=\,3,387,014). Consistent with frontier settlement theory, results from multilevel modelling revealed that mountainous areas were lower on agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism and conscientiousness but higher on openness to experience. Conditional random forest algorithms confirmed mountainousness as a meaningful predictor of personality when tested against a conservative set of controls. East--west comparisons highlighted potential differences between ecological (driven by physical features) and sociocultural (driven by social norms) effects of mountainous terrain.},

Traditional approaches to the study of science, such as the history and philosophy of science, involve closely reading a relatively small set of journal articles. And yet many questions benefit from casting a wider net: Is most scientific change gradual or revolutionary? What are the key sources of scientific novelty? Over the past several decades, a massive effort to digitize the academic literature and equip computers with algorithms that can distantly read and analyze a digital database has taken us one step closer to answering these questions. The Dynamics of Science brings together a diverse array of contributors to examine the largely unexplored computational frontiers of history and philosophy of science. Together, they reveal how tools and data from automated textual analysis, or machine ``reading,'' combined with methods and models from game theory and cultural evolutionary theory, can begin to answer fundamental questions about the nature and history of science.},

  abstract = {In recent years, virtue epistemology has won the attention of a wide range of philosophers. A developed form of the position has been expounded forcefully by Ernest Sosa and represents the most plausible version of reliabilism to date. Through the person of Alvin Plantinga, virtue epistemology has taken philosophy of religion by storm, evoking objections and defenses in a wide variety of journals and volumes. Historically, virtue epistemology has its roots in the work of Thomas Reid, and the explosion of Reid scholarship in the last few years is perhaps both a cause and an effect of recent interest in the position.             In this paper I want to examine the virtues and vices of virtue epistemology. My conclusion will be that the position is correct, when qualified appropriately. The central claim of virtue epistemology is that, Gettier problems aside, knowledge is true belief which results from a cognitive virtue. In section one I will clarify this claim with some brief remarks about the nature of virtues in general, and cognitive virtues in particular. In section two I will consider two objections to the theory of knowledge which results. In section three of the paper I will argue that virtue epistemology can be qualified so as to avoid the objections raised in section two. Finally, I will argue that the amendments which solve the objections of section two also allow us to solve a version of the dreaded generality problem.},

  abstract = {Objective To understand belief in a specific scientific claim by studying the pattern of citations among papers stating it. Design A complete citation network was constructed from all PubMed indexed English literature papers addressing the belief that {$\beta$} amyloid, a protein accumulated in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, is produced by and injures skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myositis. Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this network. Main outcome measures Citation bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining authority. Results The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220 553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding. Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes the political agenda of the European Parliament (EP) plenary, how it has evolved over time, and the manner in which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have reacted to external and internal stimuli when making plenary speeches. To unveil the plenary agenda and detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, MEP speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method based on two layers of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999-2014. Our findings suggest that two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing dynamic topic modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche topics and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods. Substantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP evolves significantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis. MEP contributions to the plenary agenda are also found to be impacted upon by voting behaviour and the committee structure of the Parliament.},

Researchers may wish to compare a network of interest to a ``typical'' graph from a family (or ensemble) of graphs which are similar in some way. One way to do this is to take a sample of several random graphs from the family, to gather information about what is ``typical''. Hence there is a need for algorithms which can generate graphs uniformly (or approximately uniformly) at random from the given family. Since a large sample may be required, the algorithm should also be computationally efficient.},

Against an outline of standard philosophical characteristics and a recent turn to social epistemology, this paper surveys highlights within two strands of computational philosophy of science that attempt to work toward an answer to this question. Both strands emerge from abstract rational choice theory and the analytic tradition in philosophy of science rather than postmodern sociology of science. The first strand of computational research models the effect of communicative networks within groups, with conclusions regarding the potential benefit of limited communication. The second strand models the potential benefits of cognitive diversity within groups. Examples from each strand of research are used in analyzing what makes modeling of this sort both promising and distinctly philosophical, but are also used to emphasize possibilities for failure and inherent limitations as well.},

Given the increased usage of such algorithms through smart devices, such beliefs are becoming increasingly common in everyday life. First, I argue that such beliefs can be successful (i.e. justified and true) by outlining particular examples that possess epistemic properties taken to be indicative of successful beliefs (i.e. being a reason for action, being reliable, being safe, and being sensitive). I then outline how computational beliefs are best understood as a form of what Sosa [(2006). `Knowledge: Instrumental and Testimonial'. In The Epistemology of Testimony, edited by Jennifer Lackey, and Ernest Sosa. Oxford: Oxford University Press] describes as instrumental beliefs. As such, it may be thought that computational beliefs hold little epistemological interest insofar as they are reducible to more basic epistemic processes that are already the focus of epistemological attention. However, in the final section, I argue that computational beliefs hold epistemological importance insofar as they have specific epistemically normative repercussions i.e. they give rise to epistemic responsibility gaps.},

It is argued that in the age of globalization, when the humankind has found itself at the new developmental turning point, in the epoch when the influence of various individuals could affect dramatically the further development of the whole world, there is an urgent necessity to return to the analysis of this issue. In the first part of this article the history of views on this problem from the antiquity to contemporary counterfactual history is considered. In the second part the author aims at presenting the complex of factors affecting the role of individuals as a conceptual system. He suggests that depending on various conditions and circumstances and with the account of specific features of historical place and time and personal characteristics, the historical role of an individual may fluctuate from the absolutely invisible up to the greatest one. A conclusion is made that the weaker and less stable is a society, the more destroyed are the old structures, the greater may be the personality's impact. In other words, the role of an individual is inversely correlated with society's stability and strength. The paper presents the model which includes four society's state phases: 1) stable society of the monarchic type; 2) social pre-revolutionary crisis; 3) revolution; 4) creation of a new order. It is shown that a personality's greatest influence is observed at the third and fourth stages while at the first stage the influence is usually considerably weaker.},

More specifically, BERTopic generates document embedding with pre-trained transformer-based language models, clusters these embeddings, and finally, generates topic representations with the class-based TF-IDF procedure. BERTopic generates coherent topics and remains competitive across a variety of benchmarks involving classical models and those that follow the more recent clustering approach of topic modeling.},

  abstract = {Partisan conflicts have been frequently analysed in comparative political science research. Yet little is known about the dimensions of political conflict at the local level in multi-level democracies. This article contributes to the literature on the estimation and analysis of party positions by first presenting a new dataset of more than 800 local party manifestos in Germany that allows for a systematic analysis of the dimensions of political conflict at the German local level. Secondly, it is demonstrated that (semi-)automatic content analysis of these texts offers a promising approach for gaining new insights into local party positions. Thirdly, the empirical analysis of German local party manifestos shows that partisan conflicts are not only structured along the left--right dimension but also along a dimension which distinguishes between parties addressing `local' and `national' issues to a varying degree in their manifestos, due to the different behaviour of established and populist parties.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a plethora of high-p\- rofile scientific publications has been reporting about machine learning algorithms outperforming clinicians in medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-\-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-\-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-\-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-\-making in healthcare.},

Clustering algorithms specialized to deal with complex networks are called community discovery. Notwithstanding their common objectives, there are crucial assumptions in community discovery -- edge sparsity and only one node type, among others -- which makes its mapping to clustering non trivial. In this paper, we propose a community discovery to clustering mapping, by focusing on transactional data clustering. We represent a network as a transactional dataset, and we find communities by grouping nodes with common items (neighbors) in their baskets (neighbor lists). By comparing our results with ground truth communities and state of the art community discovery methods, we show that transactional clustering algorithms are a feasible alternative to community discovery, and that a complete mapping of the two problems is possible.},

We introduce a mechanistic, agentbased model of information overload and investigate the effects of information overload threshold and rate of information loss on observed online phenomena. We find that conversation volume and participation are lowest under high information overload thresholds and mid-range rates of information loss. Calibrating the model to user responsiveness data on Twitter, we replicate and explain several observed phenomena: 1) Responsiveness is sensitive to information overload threshold at high rates of information loss; 2) Information overload threshold and rate of information loss are Pareto-optimal and users may experience overload at inflows exceeding 30 notifications per hour; 3) Local abundance of small cascades of modest global popularity and local scarcity of larger cascades of high global popularity explains why overloaded users receive, but do not respond to large, highly popular cascades; 4) Users typically work with 7 notifications per hour; 5) Over-exposure to information can suppress the likelihood of response by overloading users, contrary to analogies to biologically-inspired viral spread. Reconceptualizing information spread with the mechanisms of information overload creates a richer representation of online conversation dynamics, enabling a deeper understanding of how (dis)information is transmitted over social media.},

  abstract = {Human flourishing is often severely limited by persistent violence. Quantitative conflict research has found common temporal [1], [2] and other statistical patterns in warfare [3], but very little is understood about its general spatial patterns. While the importance of topology in geostrategy has long been recognized [4], [5], the role of spatial patterns in determining a region's vulnerability to conflict is not well understood. Here, we use network science to show that global patterns in war and peace are closely related to the relative position of cities in a global interaction network. We find that regions with betweenness centrality above a certain threshold are often engulfed in entrenched conflict, while a high degree correlates with peace. In fact, betweenness accounts for over 80\% of the variance in number of attacks. This metric is also a good predictor of the distance to a conflict zone and can estimate the risk of conflict. We conjecture that a high betweenness identifies areas with fuzzy cultural boundaries [6], whereas high degree cities are in cores where peace is more easily maintained. This is supported by a simple agent-based model in which cities influence their neighbours, which exhibits the same threshold behaviour with betweenness as seen in conflict data. These findings not only shed new light on the causes of violence, but could be used to estimate the risk associated with actions such as the merging of cities, construction of transportation infrastructure, or interventions in trade or migration patterns.},

  abstract = {Simple weighted averaging of word vectors often yields effective representations for sentences which outperform sophisticated seq2seq neural models in many tasks. While it is desirable to use the same method to represent documents as well, unfortunately, the effectiveness is lost when representing long documents involving multiple sentences. One of the key reasons is that a longer document is likely to contain words from many different topics; hence, creating a single vector while ignoring all the topical structure is unlikely to yield an effective document representation. This problem is less acute in single sentences and other short text fragments where the presence of a single topic is most likely. To alleviate this problem, we present P-SIF, a partitioned word averaging model to represent long documents. P-SIF retains the simplicity of simple weighted word averaging while taking a document's topical structure into account. In particular, PSIF learns topic-specific vectors from a document and finally concatenates them all to represent the overall document. We provide theoretical justifications on the correctness of P-SIF. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we demonstrate P-SIF's effectiveness compared to simple weighted averaging and many other baselines.},

We find evidence for the latter by analyzing the learned representations of three spatial datasets (world, US, NYC places) and three temporal datasets (historical figures, artworks, news headlines) in the Llama-2 family of models. We discover that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales. These representations are robust to prompting variations and unified across different entity types (e.g. cities and landmarks). In addition, we identify individual ``space neurons'' and ``time neurons'' that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates. While further investigation is needed, our results suggest modern LLMs learn rich spatiotemporal representations of the real world and possess basic ingredients of a world model.},

While the study of origins is foundational to many scientific fields, such as physics and biology, it has rarely been pursued in the social sciences. Yet knowledge of something's origins often gives us new insights into the present.  In Ex Machina, John H. Miller introduces a methodology for exploring systems of adaptive, interacting, choice-making agents, and uses this approach to identify conditions sufficient for the emergence of social behavior. Miller combines ideas from biology, computation, game theory, and the social sciences to evolve a set of interacting automata from asocial to social behavior.  Readers will learn how systems of simple adaptive agents---seemingly locked into an asocial morass---can be rapidly transformed into a bountiful social world driven only by a series of small evolutionary changes. Such unexpected revolutions by evolution may provide an important clue to the emergence of social life.},

  pages = {44},
  abstract = {Scholars have long debated why the sciences became organized into specialized disciplines during the nineteenth century. The Prussian university reforms and the institutionalization of research in the German universities have occupied a central position in these discussions. Using records of the appointments of full professors in the life sciences at German universities from 1770 to 1880, this paper investigates whether the Prussian and other reforms led professors to specialize into disciplines and universities to hire from an open academic labor market. The results show that the reforms did not encourage competition and disciplinary specialization across the German universities. Until the 1840s, reforms encouraged professors to pursue scientific research to the exclusion of traditional subjects, but not to specialize within single disciplines. Outside of Prussia, Baden, and Bavaria, university hiring practices also continued to favor the internal promotion of students until relatively late in the century. In contrast to theories of disciplinary specialization emphasizing the institutionalization of scientific autonomy through the Prussian university reforms, I argue that the political integration of German territories and the exploding university enrollments of the late nineteenth century were necessary conditions for the initial adoption of disciplinary organization. These changes did not directly follow from the university reforms, but rather we connected to the ongoing political and economic development of German states over the course of the nineteenth century.},

The core package provides data structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and self loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility mades NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for eash exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdoes-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models, are included. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.},

(2) It involves a problematic combination of both epistemic virtues and vices. And (3) it lacks an adequate basis for trust in its information sources. In response to Harris, this article argues that, like previous criticisms, these criticisms do little to undermine conspiracy theorizing as such. And they do not give us good reasons to dismiss any particular conspiracy theory without consideration of the relevant evidence.},

  abstract = {This systematic review used ``science mapping'' as a means of understanding the evolution of research in educational administration (EA). The review sought to document the size and geographic distribution of EA research, identify high impact scholars and documents, and illuminate the ``intellectual structure'' of the field. Although science mapping has been applied widely in science, medicine, and other social sciences, it is still new in the field of education. The authors identified 22,361 peer-reviewed articles published in 22 Scopus-indexed EA journals between 1960 and 2018. The authors used VOSviewer, Excel, and Tableau software to analyze the data set. The review found that the EA knowledge base has grown dramatically since 1960 with an accelerating rate growth and increasing gender and geographic diversity. Using citation analyses, the review identified canonical documents, defined as highly influential documents whose impact has been sustained for a period of several decades. The review also identified four key Schools of Thoughts that have emerged over time focusing on Leadership for Learning, Leadership and Cultural Change, School Effectiveness and School Improvement, and Leading Teachers. More broadly, these findings highlighted a paradigm shift from ``school administration'' to ``school leadership'' over the course of the six decades. Another significant finding identified ``leadership for student learning and development'' as the ``cognitive anchor'' of the intellectual structure of the EA knowledge base. The authors conclude that science mapping offers a new and useful means of unpacking the historical development of fields of study.},

We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

Franco Moretti, perhaps the most prominent practitioner of the most prominent discipline of DH---``distant reading,'' the computational analysis of large quantities of literary texts---recently expressed his exasperation with the state of DH, reflecting ``our work could have been better'' and asking why, ``considering the amount of energy, talent, and tools, going into [DH], that we have such difficulty producing great results.'' Surveying leading recent work in distant reading by Moretti, Matthew L. Jockers, Laura Mandell, Ryan Heuser, Long Le-Khac, and Joanna Swafford, this paper provides a twofold explanation to the field's failure to produce ``great results.'' Both explanations relate to ``validation,'' the process by which quantitative results are shown to be reliable and trustworthy. Many distant reading projects have produced disappointing results because they have been more interested in validating their tools---showing that their computational methods are able to confirm existing stereotypes---than in pursuing genuine discoveries. Many others, meanwhile, produce provocative results that cannot be meaningfully validated. Although the double bind of validation is real, I propose collaboration and ``interdisciplinary adaptation'' as promising solutions.},

There are different task variants, e.g., stance of a tweet vs. a full article, or stance with respect to a claim vs. an (implicit) topic. Moreover, task definitions vary, which includes the label inventory, the data collection, and the annotation protocol. All these aspects hinder cross-domain studies, as they require changes to standard domain adaptation approaches. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of 16 stance detection datasets, and we explore the possibility for cross-domain learning from them. Moreover, we propose an end-to-end unsupervised framework for outof-domain prediction of unseen, user-defined labels. In particular, we combine domain adaptation techniques such as mixture of experts and domain-adversarial training with label embeddings, and we demonstrate sizable performance gains over strong baselines -- both (i) indomain, i.e., for seen targets, and (ii) out-ofdomain, i.e., for unseen targets. Finally, we perform an exhaustive analysis of the crossdomain results, and we highlight the important factors influencing the model performance.},

As a result, these models more closely correspond with real-world communities, and are better suited for informing policy decisions than extant how-possibly models. I provide an exemplar of a mid-level model of science funding allocation that incorporates bibliometric data from scientific publications and data generated from empirical studies of peer review into an epistemic landscape model. The results of my model show that on a dynamic epistemic landscape, allocating funding by modified and pure lottery strategies performs comparably to a perfect selection funding allocation strategy.

  abstract = {This paper provides an account of mid-level models which calibrate highly theoretical agent-based models of scientific communities by incorporating empirical information from real-world systems. As a result, these models more closely correspond with real-world communities, and are better suited for informing policy decisions than extant how-possibly models. I provide an exemplar of a mid-level model of science funding allocation that incorporates bibliometric data from scientific publications and data generated from empirical studies of peer review into an epistemic landscape model. The results of my model show that on a dynamic epistemic landscape, allocating funding by modified and pure lottery strategies performs comparably to a perfect selection funding allocation strategy. These results support the idea that introducing randomness into a funding allocation process may be a tractable policy worth exploring further through pilot studies. My exemplar shows that agent-based models need not be restricted to the abstract and the apriori; they can also be informed by empirical data.},

The rapid growth of this technology has raised important questions about its potential impact on political action and polarization. We propose a framework to address how Selection, Platform Design, Incentives, and Real-World Context (the SPIR framework) might explain social media's role in exacerbating polarization and intergroup conflict. Rather than simply asking whether social media as a whole causes polarization, we examine how each of these processes can spur polarization in certain contexts. Specifically, we explain how these features of social media can act as an accelerant, amplifying divisions in society between social groups and spilling over into offline behavior. We discuss how interventions might target each of these factors to mitigate (or enhance) polarization.},

It has the advantage that group members can learn from each other and that, at the end, often a consensus emerges that everybody endorses. Unfortunately, however, implementing a deliberation procedure also has a number of disadvantages due to the cognitive limitations of the individual group members. What is more, the very process of deliberation introduces an additional bias, which we investigate in this article. We demonstrate that even in a group of (boundedly) rational agents the resulting consensus (if there is one) depends on the order in which the group members speak. More specifically, the group member who speaks first has an unproportionally high impact on the final decision, which we interpret as a new instance of the wellknown anchoring effect. To show this, we construct and analyze an agent-based model -- inspired by the disagreement debate in social epistemology -- and obtain analytical results for homogeneous groups (i.e., for groups whose members consider each other as epistemic peers) as well as simulation results for inhomogeneous groups.},

  abstract = {Shifting dietary patterns for environmental benefits has long been advocated. In relation to mitigating climate change, the debate has been more recent, with a growing interest from policy makers, academics, and society. Many researchers have highlighted the need for changes to food consumption in order to achieve the required greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. So far, food consumption has not been anchored in climate change policy to the same extent as energy production and usage, nor has it been considered within the context of achieving GHG targets to a level where tangible outputs are available. Here, we address those issues by performing a relatively simple analysis that considers the extent to which one food exchange could contribute to achieving GHG reduction targets in the United States (US). We use the targeted reduction for 2020 as a reference and apply published Life Cycle Assessment data on GHG emissions to beans and beef consumed in the US. We calculate the difference in GHGs resulting from the replacement of beef with beans in terms of both calories and protein. Our results demonstrate that substituting one food for another, beans for beef, could achieve approximately 46 to 74\% of the reductions needed to meet the 2020 GHG target for the US. In turn, this shift would free up 42\% of US cropland (692,918 km2). While not currently recognized as a climate policy option, the ``beans for beef'' scenario offers significant climate change mitigation and other environmental benefits, illustrating the high potential of animal to plant food shifts.},

  abstract = {Evolution is a blind fitting process by which organisms, over generations, adapt to the niches of an ever-changing environment. Does the mammalian brain use similar brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act upon the world? Recent advances in training deep neural networks has exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic weights to map millions of observations along ecologically relevant objective functions. This class of models has dramatically outstripped simpler, more intuitive models, operating robustly in real-life contexts spanning perception, language, and action coordination. These models do not learn an explicit, human-interpretable representation of the underlying structure of the data; rather, they use local computations to interpolate over task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space. Furthermore, counterintuitively, over-parameterized models, similarly to evolutionary processes, can be simple and parsimonious as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. In contrast to traditional scientific models, where the ultimate goal is interpretability, over-parameterized models eschew interpretability in favor of solving real-life problems or tasks. We contend that over-parameterized blind fitting presents a radical challenge to many of the underlying assumptions and practices in computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. At the same time, this shift in perspective informs longstanding debates and establishes unexpected links with evolution, ecological psychology, and artificial life.},

We repeat the analysis for probabilistic methods and show that they naturally recover the geometric structure. Fully exploiting this structure, however, requires the development of stochastic extensions to classic Riemannian geometry. We take early steps in that regard. Finally, we partly extend the analysis to models based on neural networks, thereby highlighting geometric and probabilistic shortcomings of current deep generative models.},

  abstract = {Despite global connectivity, societies seem to be increasingly polarized and fragmented. This phenomenon is rooted in the underlying complex structure and dynamics of social systems. Far from homogeneously mixing or adopting conforming views, individuals self-organize into groups at multiple scales, ranging from families up to cities and cultures. In this paper, we study the fragmented structure of American society using mobility and communication networks obtained from geo-located social media data. We find self-organized patches with clear geographical borders that are consistent between physical and virtual spaces. The patches have multi-scale structure ranging from parts of a city up to the entire nation. Their significance is reflected in distinct patterns of collective interests and conversations. Finally, we explain the patch emergence by a model of network growth that combines mechanisms of geographical distance gravity, preferential attachment and spatial growth. Our observations are consistent with the emergence of social groups whose separated association and communication reinforce distinct identities. Rather than eliminating borders, the virtual space reproduces them as people mirror their offline lives online. Understanding the mechanisms driving the emergence of fragmentation in hyper-connected social systems is imperative in the age of the Internet and globalization.},

We formalise in this model the generalised quantifier theory of natural language, due to Barwise and Cooper. The underlying setting is a compact closed category with bialgebras. We start from a generative grammar formalisation and develop an abstract categorical compositional semantics for it, then instantiate the abstract setting to sets and relations and to finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps. We prove the equivalence of the relational instantiation to the truth theoretic semantics of generalised quantifiers. The vector space instantiation formalises the statistical usages of words and enables us to, for the first time, reason about quantified phrases and sentences compositionally in distributional semantics.},

A number of recent papers have discussed the question what a desirable mixture of mavericks and followers looks like. Answering this question is most useful if a scientific community can be steered toward such a desirable mixture. One attractive route is through credit incentives: manipulating rewards so that reward-seeking scientists are likely to form the desired mixture of their own accord. Here I argue that (even in theory) this idea is less straightforward than it may seem. Interpreting mavericks as scientists who prioritize rewards over speed and risk, I show in a deliberatively simple model that there is a fixed mixture which is not particularly likely to be desirable and which credit incentives cannot alter. I consider a way around this result, but this has some major drawbacks. I conclude that credit incentives are not as promising a way to create a desirable mixture of mavericks and followers as one might have thought.},

IQ was assessed by B{\o}rge Priens Pr{\o}ve at age 18. Unsuccessful educational achievement was indicated by leaving lower secondary school without a certificate, by no completed youth education at age 25, by no completed education leading to vocational qualifications at age 30, and by the total number of interruptions to education at age 30. Unsuccessful occupational achievement was indicated by not being in employment, education or training at age 30, by unemployment at age 30, by receiving sickness benefits at age 30, by receiving welfare benefits at age 30, by receiving disability pension at age 30, and by gross income at age 30. Binary logistic regression, negative binomial regression and median regression were used to estimate the associations of IQ with unsuccessful educational and occupational achievement. The results showed that low IQ was a strong and consistent predictor of all indicators of unsuccessful educational and occupational achievement. In conclusion, the study findings suggest that assessment of intelligence may provide crucial information for educational planning and counselling of poor-functioning schoolchildren and adolescents with regard to both the immediate educational goals and the more distant work-related future.},

From a more abstract point of view, we model the influence of a signal, that is constant, may have different intensities, and is `heard' only by agents with opinions, that are not too far away. For such a dynamic a Constant Signal Theorem is proven. In the model we get a lot of surprising effects. For instance, the more intensive signal may have less effect; more radicals may lead to less radicalization of normal agents. The model is an extremely simple conceptual model. Under some assumptions the whole parameter space can be analyzed. The model inspires new possible explanations, new perspectives for empirical studies, and new ideas for prevention or intervention policies.},

We use the ground truths to test two data models (direct citation and bibliographic coupling) with two algorithms (the Leiden algorithm and the Infomap algorithm). Our results are discomforting: none of the four combinations leads to a consistent reconstruction of the ground truths. No combination of data model and algorithm simultaneously reconstructs all micro-level topics at any resolution level. Meso-level topics are not reconstructed at all. This suggests (a) that we are currently unable to predict which combination of data model, algorithm and parameter setting will adequately reconstruct which (types of) topics, and (b) that a combination of several data models, algorithms and parameter settings appears to be necessary to reconstruct all or most topics in a set of papers.},

Drawing on their paper and existing literature, I evaluate LLMs' role under their proposed framework: as computational microscopes, resources of inspiration, and agents of understanding. I argue that LLMs offer significant utility in facilitating tasks related to the first two domains, such as code generation, text generation, and knowledge extraction. However, I argue that their ability to serve as an agent of understanding is infeasible; LLMs will not autonomously generate new scientific understanding and communicate that knowledge to humans. I will argue this with thought experiments, analogies, and relevant literature. Ultimately, I aim to demonstrate that human-LLM interaction can advance scientific understanding through various means, although human involvement will probably remain essential in this process.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach to detecting scientists' field mobility by focusing on an author's self-citation network, and the co-authorships and keywords in self-citing articles. Contrary to much previous literature on self-citations, we will show that author's self-citation patterns reveal important information on the development and emergence of new research topics over time. More specifically, we will discuss self-citations as a means to detect scientists' field mobility. We introduce a network based definition of field mobility, using the Optimal Percolation Method (Lambiotte \& Ausloos, 2005; 2006). The results of the study can be extended to selfcitation networks of groups of authors and, generally also for other types of networks.},

Models predict widespread moral judgments about diverse text scenarios. This requires connecting physical and social world knowledge to value judgements, a capability that may enable us to filter out needlessly inflammatory chatbot outputs or eventually regularize open-ended reinforcement learning agents. With the ETHICS dataset, we find that current language models have a promising but incomplete understanding of basic ethical knowledge. Our work shows that progress can be made on machine ethics today, and it provides a steppingstone toward AI that is aligned with human values.},

This account acknowledges that novel ideas must be elaborated on and conceptually translated before they can be adopted and applied to field-specific problems. We motivate our account by examining an exemplary case of knowledge diffusion, namely, the early spread of theories of rational decision-making. These theories were grounded in a set of novel mathematical tools and concepts that originated in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944/1947) and subsequently spread widely across the social and behavioral sciences. Introducing a network-based diffusion measure, we trace the spread of those tools and concepts into distinct research areas. We furthermore present an analytically tractable typology for classifying publications according to their roles in the diffusion process. The proposed framework allows for a systematic examination of the conditions under which scientific innovations spread within and across preexisting and newly emerging scientific communities.},

In this paper, we present findings from an explorative study in which we analyze the interests, abilities, beliefs, attitudes, perceptions, and goals of bachelor students in a semester-long philosophy of science course at a major German university. We furthermore make the first attempt to compare women-only learning environments with mixed learning environments. Our results suggest that while there are generally some gender differences regarding interests, abilities, beliefs, attitudes, perceptions, and goals of students in the classroom, most of the hypotheses we explore to explain dropout rates by gender differences cannot be supported. We conclude that possible factors leading to an underrepresentation of women in academic philosophy in Germany might be found in the social and institutional environment within which academic philosophy is studied.},

  abstract = {As of late, the sociology of intellectuals has made important inroads into its object of study. Much of this has been achieved by problematising the modes of engagement intellectuals undertake and multiplying the types of actor that can be considered to have intellectual authority, going beyond the traditional mould of the `authoritative' public intellectual. However, relatively few have theorised how intellectuals associate themselves in groups: how collectives, whether in the form of institutions or not, negotiate their public interventions and position themselves as a group in the public debate. This article delves into this issue, with an emphasis on how `intellectual collectives' reach a common identity and decide who can intervene `on their behalf' -- what we call prosopopoeia. Informed by positioning theory, and based on two variables (presence of a single organisational basis and purported intellectual cohesiveness), this article contributes to current debates on the sociology of intellectuals by analysing how collectives of intellectuals intervene in the public debate, reach some form of coordination with their peers, police the boundaries of their collective identity, and, in the process, attain a common position across audiences.},

It is unclear, however, if this toolset applies to other creative domains beyond the sciences. In particular, while performance in the arts has long been difficult to quantify objectively, research suggests that professional networks and prestige of affiliations play a similar role to those observed in science, hence they can reveal patterns underlying successful careers. To test this hypothesis, here we focus on ballet, as it allows us to investigate in a quantitative fashion the interplay of individual performance, institutional prestige, and network effects. We analyze data on competition outcomes from 6363 ballet students affiliated with 1603 schools in the United States, who participated in the Youth America Grand Prix (YAGP) between 2000 and 2021. Through multiple logit models and matching experiments, we provide evidence that schools' strategic network position bridging between communities captures social prestige and predicts the placement of students into jobs in ballet companies. This work reveals the importance of institutional prestige on career success in ballet and showcases the potential of network science approaches to provide quantitative viewpoints for the professional development of careers beyond science.},

Here, we study the colocation patterns of more than one million amenities in 47 U.S. cities to model the amenity mix of neighborhoods, and to identify the amenities that are over- or under-supplied in a neighborhood. We build this model by combining a clustering algorithm, designed to identify amenity-dense neighborhoods, and a network, connecting amenities that are likely to collocate. Our findings extend generative and parametric urban design approaches to the amenity mix of neighborhoods, by leveraging the idea of relatedness from the economic geography literature, to evaluate and optimize a neighborhood's amenity mix.},

  abstract = {Although recent research acknowledges the potential of visualization methods in digital humanities (DH), the predominant terminology used to describe visualizations (prototypes, tools) focuses on their use as a means to an end and, more importantly, as an instrument in the service of humanities research. We introduce the sandcastle as a metaphorical lens and provocative term to highlight visualization as a research process in its own right. We argue that building visualization sandcastles provides a holistic approach to crossdisciplinary knowledge generation that embraces visualization as (1) an aesthetic provocation to elicit critical insights, interpretation, speculation, and discussions within and beyond scholarly audiences, (2) a dynamic process wherein speculation and re-interpretation advance knowledge within all disciplines involved, and (3) a mediator of ideas and theories within and across disciplines. Our argument is grounded in critical theory, DH, design, human computer interaction (HCI), and visualization, and based on our own research on an exceptional literary collection. We argue that considering visualizations as sandcastles foregrounds valuable insights into the roles of visualization as a mindset, methodology, and praxis within humanities research and beyond.},

  abstract = {In problem solving, the paths towards solutions can be viewed as a sequence of decisions. The decisions, made by humans or computers, describe a trajectory through a high-dimensional representation space of the problem. Using dimensionality reduction, these trajectories can be visualized in lower dimensional space. Such embedded trajectories have previously been applied to a wide variety of data, but so far, almost exclusively the self-similarity of single trajectories has been analyzed. In contrast, we describe patterns emerging from drawing many trajectories---for different initial conditions, end states, or solution strategies---in the same embedding space. We argue that general statements about the problem solving tasks and solving strategies can be made by interpreting these patterns. We explore and characterize such patterns in trajectories resulting from human and machine-made decisions in a variety of application domains: logic puzzles (Rubik's cube), strategy games (chess), and optimization problems (neural network training). In the context of Rubik's cube, we present a physical interactive demonstrator that uses trajectory visualization to provide immediate feedback to users regarding the consequences of their decisions. We also discuss the importance of suitably chosen representation spaces and similarity metrics for the embedding.},

In parametric DR, neural networks are trained to embed high-dimensional data items in a low-dimensional space while minimizing an objective function. ParaDime builds on the idea that the objective functions of several modern DR techniques result from transformed inter-item relationships. It provides a common interface to specify the way these relations and transformations are computed and how they are used within the losses that govern the training process. Through this interface, ParaDime unifies parametric versions of DR techniques such as metric MDS, t-SNE, and UMAP. Furthermore, it allows users to fully customize each aspect of the DR process. We show how this ease of customization makes ParaDime suitable for experimenting with interesting techniques, such as hybrid classification/embedding models or supervised DR, which opens up new possibilities for visualizing high-dimensional data.},

  abstract = {Recent epistemology of modality has seen a growing trend towards metaphysics-first approaches. Contrastingly, this paper offers a more philosophically modest account of justifying modal claims, focusing on the practices of scientific modal inferences. Two ways of making such inferences are identified and analyzed: actualist-manipulationist modality (AM) and relative modality (RM). In AM, what is observed to be or not to be the case in actuality or under manipulations, allows us to make modal inferences. AM-based inferences are fallible, but the same holds for practically all empirical inquiry. In RM, modal inferences are evaluated relative to what is kept fixed in a system, like a theory or a model. RM-based inferences are more certain but framework-dependent. While elements from both AM and RM can be found in some existing accounts of modality, it is worth highlighting them in their own right and isolating their features for closer scrutiny. This helps to establish their relevant epistemologies that are free from some strong philosophical assumptions often attached to them in the literature. We close by showing how combining these two routes amounts to a view that accounts for a rich variety of modal inferences in science.},

Using a one-million word corpus along with input from disciplinary experts, findings include analytic philosophy's tendency to limit lexical richness and use shorter sentences, self-mention, and imperative directives to a much greater extent than continental philosophy. This study has implications for further research on philosophy texts, students entering the discipline, and those who enable them to become members of this community.},

  abstract = {Bieri answers the heading of his polemic pamphlet, 'What remains of analytic philosophy?', by essentially passing his opinion on what should remain of it. This shift is, I think, symptomatic of the slight mist of imprecision which permeates many parts of his article. Anyway, it is not all too much that, in his eyes, ought to be retained - first of all, ironically, 'the standards of clarity and notional lucidity set by analytic philosophy' (342). Bieri's principle target is analytic philosophy done in a linguistic key, i.e., linguistic philosophy (though he does not bother to say what analytic philosophy might look like if it were bereft of its linguistic dimension). He seems to take it that the 'linguistic turn' has been based on the 'dogma that all interesting questions of philosophy could be spelled out as questions about words and the logical structure of sentences' (340). That this is utterly untrue has been shown by J. L. Austin, R. M. Hare, and many others: The proper philosophical scrutiny of words is eo ipso a scrutiny of the things they stand for. In other words: The linguistic philosopher does not confine himself to scrutinising matters linguistic and logical; only, he pays due attention to such matters, too. Bieri believes, however, that there are prominent philosophical problems ' in dealing with which you won't get far by doing linguistic analysis', above all 'mental causation' and 'our will to morally restrict our freedom of action' (340). As the latter two problems happen to precisely indicate my own main fields of research, in which I have published since decades, I felt challenged to demarcate how, in my opinion, linguistic methods and the use of formalised extended logics can efficiently contribute to philosophical research into mind-body problems and metaethics. As opposed to Bieri's prejudice that all analytic judgements are as barren as the wellknown 'bachelor'-examples, I refer to my detailed attempts, based on an integrated logic of conviction and intention, to show the analyticity of what I call the 'Universal Golden Rule' - though we must not shut our eyes in face of the fact that the conception of analyticity (be it philosophically fertile or barren) has its price, namely, the dependence of analytical truths on the personal 'idiolectal and imaginative competence' of the given speaker / hearer.}

We show that the locations and scales of latent space cluster models can be inferred from the number of connections between groups alone. We demonstrate this modelling approach using synthetic data and apply it to friendships between students collected as part of the Add Health study, eliminating the need for node-level connection data. The method thus protects the privacy of individuals and simplifies data sharing. It also offers performance advantages over node-level latent space models because the computational cost scales with the number of clusters rather than the number of nodes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a succinct review of attempts in the literature to use game theory to model decision making scenarios relevant to defence applications. Game theory has been proven as a very effective tool in modelling decision making processes of intelligent agents, entities, and players. It has been used to model scenarios from diverse fields such as economics, evolutionary biology, and computer science. In defence applications, there is often a need to model and predict actions of hostile actors, and players who try to evade or out-smart each other. Modelling how the actions of competitive players shape the decision making of each other is the forte of game theory. In past decades, there have been several studies which applied different branches of game theory to model a range of defence-related scenarios. This paper provides a structured review of such attempts, and classifies existing literature in terms of the kind of warfare modelled, the types of game used, and the players involved. in terms of the warfares modelled, we recognise that most papers which apply game theory in defence settings are concerned with command and control warfare, and can be further classified into papers dealing with (i) Resource Allocation Warfare (ii) Information Warfare (iii) Weapons Control Warfare (iv) Adversary Monitoring Warfare. We also observe that most of the reviewed papers are concerned with sensing, tracking, and large sensor networks, and the studied problems have parallels in sensor network analysis in the civilian domain. In terms of the games used, we classify the reviewed papers into papers that use non-cooperative or cooperative games, simultaneous or sequential games, discrete or continuous games, and non-zero sum or zero-sum games. Similarly, papers are also classified into two-player, three-player or multi-player game based papers. We also explore the nature of players and the construction of payoff functions in each scenario. Finally, we also identify gaps in literature where game theory could be fruitfully applied in scenarios hitherto unexplored using game theory. The presented analysis provides a concise summary about the state-of-the-art with regards to the use of game theory in defence applications, and highlights the benefits and limitations of game theory in the considered scenarios.},

This hypothesis is rejected on the basis of a text-mining approach. The present paper argues that the results they extracted do not answer the questions they set out to answer as well as would have been possible. This is due to Mizrahi and Dickinson's choice to disregard duplicate occurrences of argument word pairs, their main indicator for the occurrence of arguments in articles. This paper reconstructs their method by now also counting duplicates. A small corpus (n = 436) of recent (2015--2021) analytical and continental articles is used to rerun the experiment; the results oppose Mizrahi and Dickinson's and suggest that arguments (as operationalized by Mizrahi and Dickinson) occur more in analytical articles. The paper argues that part of the discrepancy derives from the specific methodological choices they made.},

This has led to a rallying cry for model interpretability. Yet the concept of interpretability remains nebulous, such that researchers and tool designers lack actionable guidelines for how to incorporate interpretability into models and accompanying tools. Through an iterative design process with expert machine learning researchers and practitioners, we designed a visual analytics system, Gamut, to explore how interactive interfaces could better support model interpretation. Using Gamut as a probe, we investigated why and how professional data scientists interpret models, and how interface affordances can support data scientists in answering questions about model interpretability. Our investigation showed that interpretability is not a monolithic concept: data scientists have different reasons to interpret models and tailor explanations for specific audiences, often balancing competing concerns of simplicity and completeness. Participants also asked to use Gamut in their work, highlighting its potential to help data scientists understand their own data.},

We can investigate this question only if we can quantify polarization, by taking into account how extreme the opinions of the people are, how much they organize into echo chambers, and how these echo chambers organize in the network. Current polarization estimates are insensitive to at least one of these factors: They cannot conclusively clarify the opening question. Here, we propose a measure of ideological polarization that can capture the factors we listed. The measure is based on the generalized Euclidean distance, which estimates the distance between two vectors on a network, e.g., representing people's opinion. This measure can fill the methodological gap left by the state of the art and leads to useful insights when applied to real-world debates happening on social media and to data from the U.S. Congress.},

Both leisure and occupational physical activity were based on self-report with four response categories. We observed 7913 (7.6\%) MACE and 9846 (9.5\%) deaths from all causes. Compared to low leisure time physical activity, multivariable adjusted (for lifestyle, health, living conditions, and socioeconomic factors) hazard ratios for MACE were 0.86 (0.78--0.96) for moderate, 0.77 (0.69--0.86) for high, and 0.85 (0.73--0.98) for very high activity; corresponding values for higher occupational physical activity were 1.04 (0.95--1.14), 1.15 (1.04--1.28), and 1.35 (1.14--1.59), respectively. For all-cause mortality, corresponding hazard ratios for higher leisure time physical activity were 0.74 (0.68--0.81), 0.59 (0.54--0.64), and 0.60 (0.52--0.69), and for higher occupational physical activity 1.06 (0.96--1.16), 1.13 (1.01--1.27), and 1.27 (1.05--1.54), respectively. Similar results were found within strata on lifestyle, health, living conditions, and socioeconomic factors, and when excluding individuals dying within the first 5\,years of follow-up. Levels of the two domains of physical activity did not interact on risk of MACE (P\,=\,0.40) or all-cause mortality (P\,=\,0.31).Higher leisure time physical activity associates with reduced MACE and all-cause mortality risk, while higher occupational physical activity associates with increased risks, independent of each other.},

The Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning is a comprehensive and authoritative handbook covering all the core topics of the field of thinking and reasoning. Written by the foremost experts from cognitive psychology, cognitive science, and cognitive neuroscience, individual chapters summarize basic concepts and findings for a major topic, sketch its history, and give a sense of the directions in which research is currently heading. Chapters include introductions to foundational issues and methods of study in the field, as well as treatment of specific types of thinking and reasoning and their application in a broad range of fields including business, education, law, medicine, music, and science.

Scientists may or may not be aware of all the elements that are involved in the process of generating knowledge but, whether the elements are assumed explicitly or implicitly, they have to be fixed for the production of knowledge to be coherent. I distinguish between two sets of elements of knowledge, which I call a ``baseline'' and a ``snapshot.'' The baseline represents the sum of what is, in principle, available to the community of practitioners in the field. In contrast, a snapshot is personal, that is, it is the result of applying some rules of selection to the baseline. A snapshot includes, in addition to the selected elements, idiosyncratic assessments of the elements; such assessments may not be found in the standard literature. I analyze two case studies, theoretical and experimental, in which the practitioners themselves presupposed the distinction here proposed. I show that the distinction is an effective tool in the presentation of case studies with the goal of throwing light on how scientific knowledge is modified and changed. What is illuminating in the cases at hand is the fact that the scientists themselves exhibited in their works the dynamics of ``baseline'' and ``snapshot,'' in parallel to the practice of the historians and the philosophers of science.},

  abstract = {Word embeddings are a popular way to improve downstream performances in contemporary language modeling. However, the underlying geometric structure of the embedding space is not well understood. We present a series of explorations using bio-inspired methodology to traverse and visualize word embeddings, demonstrating evidence of discernible structure. Moreover, our model also produces word similarity rankings that are plausible yet very different from common similarity metrics, mainly cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. We show that our bio-inspired model can be used to investigate how different word embedding techniques result in different semantic outputs, which can emphasize or obscure particular interpretations in textual data.},

Templates are supposed to have the dual functions of representing target systems and of facilitating quantitative manipulation. A resulting worry is that wide-ranging cross-disciplinary use of templates might compromise their representational function and reduce them to mere formalisms. In this paper, we argue that templates are valuable units of analysis in reconstructing cross-disciplinary modelling. Central to our discussion are the ways in which Lotka-Volterra models are used to analyse processes of technology diffusion. We illuminate both the similarities and differences between contributions to this case of cross-disciplinary modelling by reconstructing them as transfer of a template, without reducing the template to a mere formalism or a computational model. This requires differentiating the interpretation of templates from that of the models based on them. This differentiation allows us to claim that the LV models of technology diffusion that we review are the result of template transfer conformist in some contributions, creative in others.

Decision analysis is a process that enhances effective decision making by providing for both logical, systematic analysis and imaginative creativity. The procedure permits representing the decision-maker's information and preferences concerning the uncertain, complex, and dynamic features of the decision problem. As decision analysis has become more accepted and influential the ethical responsibility of decision analysts has increased. Analysts must be sensitive to assuming improper roles of advocacy and to participating in analyses whose means or ends are ethically repugnant. Criticisms of decision analysis are examined at three levels. Application criticisms question how much decision analysis improves actual decision making. Conceptual criticisms argue that the decomposition and recomposition of the decision analysis process may lend to a misshapen framing of the problem or to a suppression of "soft" or "fragile" considerations. Criticisms at the level of principle grant the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of decision analysis but express fear that the process may legitimize decisions otherwise questionable because of their end-state value system or their anthropocentric focus. Decision analysis is the most effective decision methodology yet advanced. Sensitivity to practical and ethical concerns about its use can only increase its effectiveness.},

Realistic longer-term projections may, however, be possible under well-defined scenarios that specify the future state of critical epidemic drivers. Since December 2020, the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) has convened multiple modeling teams to make months ahead projections of SARS-CoV-2 burden, totaling nearly 1.8 million national and state-level projections. Here, we find SMH performance varied widely as a function of both scenario validity and model calibration. We show scenarios remained close to reality for 22 weeks on average before the arrival of unanticipated SARS-CoV-2 variants invalidated key assumptions. An ensemble of participating models that preserved variation between models (using the linear opinion pool method) was consistently more reliable than any single model in periods of valid scenario assumptions, while projection interval coverage was near target levels. SMH projections were used to guide pandemic response, illustrating the value of collaborative hubs for longer-term scenario projections.},

Here, we apply deep learning to quantify total phenotypic similarity across 2468 butterfly photographs, covering 38 subspecies from the polymorphic mimicry complex of               Heliconius erato               and               Heliconius melpomene               . Euclidean phenotypic distances, calculated using a deep convolutional triplet network, demonstrate significant convergence between interspecies co-mimics. This quantitatively validates a key prediction of M{\"u}llerian mimicry theory, evolutionary biology's oldest mathematical model. Phenotypic neighbor-joining trees are significantly correlated with wing pattern gene phylogenies, demonstrating objective, phylogenetically informative phenome capture. Comparative analyses indicate frequency-dependent mutual convergence with coevolutionary exchange of wing pattern features. Therefore, phenotypic analysis supports reciprocal coevolution, predicted by classical mimicry theory but since disputed, and reveals mutual convergence as an intrinsic generator for the unexpected diversity of M{\"u}llerian mimicry. This demonstrates that deep learning can generate phenomic spatial embeddings, which enable quantitative tests of evolutionary hypotheses previously only testable subjectively.},

Here, we offer a comprehensive picture of longitudinal gender differences in performance through a bibliometric analysis of academic publishing careers by reconstructing the complete publication history of over 1.5 million gender-identified authors whose publishing career ended between 1955 and 2010, covering 83 countries and 13 disciplines. We find that, paradoxically, the increase of participation of women in science over the past 60 years was accompanied by an increase of gender differences in both productivity and impact. Most surprisingly, though, we uncover two gender invariants, finding that men and women publish at a comparable annual rate and have equivalent career-wise impact for the same size body of work. Finally, we demonstrate that differences in publishing career lengths and dropout rates explain a large portion of the reported career-wise differences in productivity and impact, although productivity differences still remain. This comprehensive picture of gender inequality in academia can help rephrase the conversation around the sustainability of women's careers in academia, with important consequences for institutions and policy makers.},

In this chapter we take a look at some of the causes of scientific fraud, and how it might be manifested in large-scale research teams and situations of anonymous authorship. We find that such cases make trouble for what might seem like intuitive answers to the question ``who should be held responsible for this fraud?'', and we argue that in such cases it would be better to hold the entire community responsible for seeing to it that there is less fraud.},

First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.},

The concepts of a computational template and a computational model are introduced as alternatives to scientific theories and laws, and it is shown how the construction process for templates allows us to hold a selective form of scientific realism. There is an important distinction between the process of construction and the process of adjustment for templates, and the latter is not subject to many conventionalist objections. Templates provide a way of re-organizing the sciences, but subject-specific knowledge is still needed to use them effectively. The important role of syntax in templates argues against the semantic account of theories.},

Using the related concepts of theoretical and formal templates, I argue that the process of applying templates can in some cases be made explicit and that we do not need to rely on similarity relations and tacit knowledge. In so doing I show how some formal models can be transferred from one scientific field to another. Examples include scale-free networks, the Lotka-Volterra model from biology, and the Goodwin model in economics. I also argue that this explicit approach has advantages over the more psychologically oriented approach of Kuhn and explain the sense in which templates do and do not produce unification.},

However, multi-platform analyses of this phenomenon remain limited due to challenges in data collection. Collecting mentions of research tracked by Altmetric LLC, we examine information retention in the over 4 million online posts referencing 9,765 of the most-mentioned scientific articles across blog sites, Facebook, news sites, Twitter, and Wikipedia. To do so, we present a burst-based framework for examining online discussions about science over time and across different platforms. To measure information retention, we develop a keyword-based computational measure comparing an online post to the scientific article's abstract. We evaluate our measure using ground truth data labeled by within field experts. We highlight three main findings: first, we find a strong tendency towards low levels of information retention, following a distinct trajectory of loss except when bursts of attention begin in social media. Second, platforms show significant differences in information retention. Third, sequences involving more platforms tend to be associated with higher information retention. These findings highlight a strong tendency towards information loss over time---posing a critical concern for researchers, policymakers, and citizens alike---but suggest that multi-platform discussions may improve information retention overall.},

This was observed both in the days of the EEC in the 1970s and the EUMaastricht treaty in the 1990s; This work aims to investigate whether this holds true in the Brexit era. We utilise social network analysis to unpack the patterns of dissent and rebellion among pairs of MPs. Using data from Hansard, we compute similarity scores between pairs of MPs from June 2017 until April 2019 and visualise them in a force-directed network. Comparing Brexit- and non-Brexit divisions, we analyse whether patterns of voting similarity and polarity differ among pairs of MPs. Our results show that Brexit causes a wedge in party politics, consistent to what is observed in history.},

  abstract = {The social adoption of change is usually hard because in reality, forces opposing the social adoption of change manifest. This situation of organizational conflict corresponds to the case where two competing groups of influential agents (``promoters'' versus ``adversaries'' of change) operate concurrently within the same organizational network. We model and explore the co-evolution of interpersonal ties and attitudes in the presence of conflict, taking into account explicitly the microscopic ``agent-to-agent'' interactions. In this perspective, we propose a new ties-attitudes co-evolution model where the diffusion of attitudes depends on the weights and the evolution of weights is formulated as a ``learning mechanism'' (weight updates depend on the previous values of both weights and attitudes). As a result, the co-evolution is intrinsic/endogenous. We simulate representative scenarios of conflict in 4 real organizational networks. In order to formulate structural balance in directed networks, we extended Heider's definition of balance considering directed triangles. The evolution of balance involves two stages: first, negative links pop up disorderly and destroy balance, but after some time, as new negative links are formed, a ``new'' balance is re-established. This ``new'' balance is emerging concurrently with the polarization of attitudes or domination of one attitude. Moreover, same-minded agents are positively linked and different-minded agents are negatively-linked. This macroscopic self-organization of the system is due only to agent-to-agent interactions, involving feedbacks on weight updates at the local microscopic level.},

A combination of network science and game theory can help explain them by examining how simple networks interact to build complex entities, both when connections among individuals are exclusively guided by self-interest or when they result from a mixture of individual and collective motivations. Here we present a theoretical framework where individuals or human groups from different communities connect to each other only if they increase their own eigenvector centrality, a topological measure of wide applications in many different contexts that quantifies the importance of a node within the network. Our analytical and numerical results show that the emergence of interconnected networks is catalyzed by the self-interest of peripheral agents, who are penalized in the long run but transiently benefit from establishing links with nodes from other communities. Moreover, the interconnection process leads to a hierarchical, assortative, and very efficient structure where links across networks involve nodes of the same importance. These findings are robust to the introduction of moderate levels of collective-oriented behavior and compatible with the interconnection dynamics observed in real-world socioeconomic networks.},

  abstract = {The characterization of phase dynamics in coupled oscillators offers insights into fundamental phenomena in complex systems. To describe the collective dynamics in the oscillatory system, order parameters are often used but are insufficient for identifying more specific behaviors. We therefore propose a topological approach that constructs quantitative features describing the phase evolution of oscillators. Here, the phase data are mapped into a high-dimensional space at each time point, and topological features describing the shape of the data are subsequently extracted from the mapped points. We extend these features to time-variant topological features by considering the evolution time, which serves as an additional dimension in the topological-feature space. The resulting time-variant features provide crucial insights into the time evolution of phase dynamics. We combine these features with the machine learning kernel method to characterize the multicluster synchronized dynamics at a very early stage of the evolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method for qualitatively explaining chimera states, which are states of stably coexisting coherent and incoherent groups in systems of identical phase oscillators. The experimental results show that our method is generally better than those using order parameters, especially if only data on the early-stage dynamics are available.},

The most remarkable patterns they form are giant rotating clusters such as balls, tori, and rings, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here we propose an agent-based model that limits the number of agents that can interact with each other. We incorporate the characteristic behaviors of fish by (i) attraction that is weakened in a dense cluster of fish, and (ii) acceleration with finite duration ("fast-start") when the fish is out of the cluster. By three-dimensional numerical simulations, we show emergence of giant rotating clusters (balls, tori, and rings) that are much larger than the radius of interaction. We present a phase diagram of patterns including polarized schools and swarms, and propose a physical mechanism that determines the cluster shape in terms of the interaction capacity and strength of attraction. Our model also indicates that each fish randomly moves back and forth between the inner and outer regions of a vortex on a large time-scale. These results show that fish without inherent chirality form giant rotating clusters spontaneously and only by short-ranged interactions.},

These claims were given cultural substance at the turn of the century by a series of expeditions undertaken by Western explorers and archaeologists, who ventured into the deserts of northwestern China in search of Greco-Indian art and antiquities. The study and display of such artifacts were motivated primarily by a desire to highlight the eastward migrations of Indo-European speakers into Central Asia. When these same expeditions began to reveal the presence of ancient Chinese ruins and antiquities as well, Chinese scholars and officials joined their Western counterparts in the field, using the material proceeds of their excavations to construct competing narratives of the westward influence of Chinese civilization. In the decades since the end of World War II, the concept of the Silk Road has come to dominate popular and scholarly associations with the region, monopolizing everything from the advertising of Central Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine to the names of academic monographs and international string ensembles.             The elusive and malleable idea of ``the Silk Road'' has provided an attractive ideological platform over the past 200 years for major political, economic, and cultural actors throughout Eurasia to assert their imagined historical importance across both time and space, often with a highly romanticized gloss. In that sense, it is a purely modern intellectual construct, one that would have been utterly unfamiliar and likely incomprehensible to those historical agents it purports to describe.},

We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

Jaderberg               et al.               designed a computer program that excels at playing the video game               Quake III Arena               in Capture the Flag mode, where two multiplayer teams compete in capturing the flags of the opposing team. The agents were trained by playing thousands of games, gradually learning successful strategies not unlike those favored by their human counterparts. Computer agents competed successfully against humans even when their reaction times were slowed to match those of humans.

However, the real world contains multiple agents, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents. We used a tournament-style evaluation to demonstrate that an agent can achieve human-level performance in a three-dimensional multiplayer first-person video game,               Quake III Arena               in Capture the Flag mode, using only pixels and game points scored as input. We used a two-tier optimization process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches on randomly generated environments. Each agent learns its own internal reward signal and rich representation of the world. These results indicate the great potential of multiagent reinforcement learning for artificial intelligence research.},

  abstract = {What is the prospect of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI)? I investigate this question by systematically comparing living and algorithmic systems, with a special focus on the notion of "agency." There are three fundamental differences to consider: (1) Living systems are autopoietic, that is, self-manufacturing, and therefore able to set their own intrinsic goals, while algorithms exist in a computational environment with target functions that are both provided by an external agent. (2) Living systems are embodied in the sense that there is no separation between their symbolic and physical aspects, while algorithms run on computational architectures that maximally isolate software from hardware. (3) Living systems experience a large world, in which most problems are ill-defined (and not all definable), while algorithms exist in a small world, in which all problems are well-defined. These three differences imply that living and algorithmic systems have very different capabilities and limitations. In particular, it is extremely unlikely that true AGI (beyond mere mimicry) can be developed in the current algorithmic framework of AI research. Consequently, discussions about the proper development and deployment of algorithmic tools should be shaped around the dangers and opportunities of current narrow AI, not the extremely unlikely prospect of the emergence of true agency in artificial systems.},

In developmental biology, this takes the form of ``positional information,'' especially in the context of morphogenbased pattern formation. Unfortunately, the concept of ``information'' is rarely defined in any precise manner. Here, we provide two alternative interpretations of ``positional information,'' and examine the complementary meanings and uses of each concept. Positional information defined as Shannon information helps us understand decoding and error propagation in patterning systems. General relativistic positional information, in contrast, provides a metric to assess the output of pattern-forming mechanisms. Both interpretations provide powerful conceptual tools that do not compete, but are best used in combination to gain a proper mechanistic understanding of robust patterning.},

Both reading techniques are the prior means of Visual Text Analysis. We present an overview of the research conducted since 2005 on supporting text analysis tasks with close and distant reading visualizations in the digital humanities. Therefore, we classify the observed papers according to a taxonomy of text analysis tasks, categorize applied close and distant reading techniques to support the investigation of these tasks, and illustrate approaches that combine both reading techniques in order to provide a multifaceted view of the textual data. In addition, we take a look at the used text sources and at the typical data transformation steps required for the proposed visualizations. Finally, we summarize collaboration experiences when developing visualizations for close and distant reading, and we give an outlook on future challenges in that research area.},

  abstract = {There exists a long-standing debate about the influence of ideology in economics. Surprisingly, however, there is no concrete empirical evidence to examine this critical issue. Using an online randomized controlled experiment involving economists in 19 countries, we examine the effect of ideological bias on views among economists. Participants were asked to evaluate statements from prominent economists on different topics, while source attribution for each statement was randomized without participants' knowledge. For each statement, participants either received a mainstream source, an ideologically different less-/non-mainstream source, or no source. We find that changing source attributions from mainstream to less-/non-mainstream, or removing them, significantly reduces economists' reported agreement with statements. Using a model of Bayesian updating we examine two competing hypotheses as potential explanations for these results: unbiased Bayesian updating versus ideologically-biased Bayesian updating. While we find no evidence in support of unbiased updating, our results are consistent with biased Bayesian updating. More specifically, we find that changing/removing sources (1) has no impact on economists' reported confidence with their evaluations; (2) similarly affects experts/non-experts in relevant areas; and (3) affects those at the far right of the political spectrum much more significantly than those at the far left. Finally, we find significant heterogeneity in our results by gender, country, PhD completion country, research area, and undergraduate major, with patterns consistent with the existence of ideological bias.},

Discussing the alternatives to traditional history of ideas in "conceptual history" and "metaphorology," it argues for the virtues of a method that acknowledges, even welcomes semantic ambiguity and the dynamic force field of relations in which ideas are historically embedded. Rather than settling for the smoothing out of differences entailed in "distant reading" techniques based on the digital retrieval of long-duration tendencies, it argues for attentiveness to the ruptures in meaning and unanticipated innovations that prevent the history of idea being an exercise in meta-narratives of growth, development and dissemination.},

  abstract = {We propose Steadiness and Cohesiveness, two novel metrics to measure the inter-cluster reliability of multidimensional projection (MDP), specifically how well the inter-cluster structures are preserved between the original high-dimensional space and the low-dimensional projection space. Measuring inter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original space from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance of inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness and Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to which clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary shapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our metrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper projection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while performing inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of inter-cluster structure.},

However, the gender discrepancy on intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction using brain imaging variables has not been studied. To this aim, we predicted individual IQ scores for males and females separately using whole-brain functional connectivity (FC). Robust predictions of intellectual capabilities were achieved across three independent data sets (680 subjects) and two intelligence measurements (IQ and f luid intelligence) using the same model within each gender. Interestingly, we found that intelligence of males and females were underpinned by different neurobiological correlates, which are consistent with their respective superiority in cognitive domains (visuospatial vs verbal ability). In addition, the identified FC patterns are uniquely predictive on IQ and its sub-domain scores only within the same gender but neither for the opposite gender nor on the IQ-irrelevant measures such as temperament traits. Moreover, females exhibit significantly higher IQ predictability than males in the discovery cohort. This findings facilitate our understanding of the biological basis of intelligence by demonstrating that intelligence is underpinned by a variety of complex neural mechanisms that engage an interacting network of regions---particularly prefrontal--parietal and basal ganglia---whereas the network pattern differs between genders.},

My aim is to delve into the essence of the Darwinian perception of beauty in the context of the Weberian concept of ``disenchantment of the world'', assumed as a possible conceptual axis that enables the unravelling of the core of this contrast of perceptions. In acknowledging the theory of evolution as one of the most prominent scientific theories likely to have contributed to disenchantment, a number of questions arise: Is disenchantment compatible with aesthetic experience and sensibility before natural beauty? Was it Darwin's disenchanted conception of the world that led him to believe he was colour blind? To answer these questions, a computer-assisted semantic analysis of lexical frequency and variability, most especially focused on aesthetic-emotional and religious or spiritual adverbs and adjectives, has been undertaken across the six editions of The Origin. The semantic analysis demonstrates that, although disenchanted, Darwin's descriptions of, mainly, the adaptational excellence of living beings, reflect an aesthetically enriched perception of nature. It is concluded that Darwin's perceptual colour blindness, then, might be based on a confusion rooted in the equation of equality between aesthetic sensibility in nature and the perception of its beauty as part of the vestigia Dei.},

  abstract = {Often machine learning programs inherit social patterns reflected in their training data without any directed effort by programmers to include such biases. Computer scientists call this algorithmic bias. This paper explores the relationship between machine bias and human cognitive bias. In it, I argue similarities between algorithmic and cognitive biases indicate a disconcerting sense in which sources of bias emerge out of seemingly innocuous patterns of information processing. The emergent nature of this bias obscures the existence of the bias itself, making it difficult to identify, mitigate, or evaluate using standard resources in epistemology and ethics. I demonstrate these points in the case of mitigation techniques by presenting what I call `the Proxy Problem'. One reason biases resist revision is that they rely on proxy attributes, seemingly innocuous attributes that correlate with socially-sensitive attributes, serving as proxies for the socially-sensitive attributes themselves. I argue that in both human and algorithmic domains, this problem presents a common dilemma for mitigation: attempts to discourage reliance on proxy attributes risk a tradeoff with judgement accuracy. This problem, I contend, admits of no purely algorithmic solution.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}While single-cell ``omics'' based measurements hold the promise of unparalleled biological insight they remain a challenge to analyze owing to their high-dimensional nature. As a result, Dimensionality Reduction (DR) algorithms are necessary for data visualization and for downstream quantitative analysis. The lack of a principled methodology for separating signal from noise in DR algorithmic outputs has limited the confident application of these methods in unsupervised analyses of single-cell data, greatly hampering researchers' ability to make data-driven discoveries. In this work we present an approach to quality assessment, \textbf{EMBEDR}, that works in conjunction with any DR algorithm to distinguish signal from noise in dimensionally-reduced representations of high-dimensional data. We apply EMBEDR to t-SNE- and UMAP-generated representations of published scRNA-seq data, revealing where lower-dimensional representations of the data are faithful renditions of biological signal in the data, and where they are more consistent with noise. EMBEDR produces easily interpreted p-values for each cell in a data set, facilitating the comparison of different DR methods and allowing optimization of their global hyperparameters. Most compellingly, EMBEDR allows for the analysis of single-cell data at a single-cell resolution, allowing DR methods to be used in a cell-wise optimal manner. Applying this technique to real data results in a biologically interpretable view of the data with no user supervision. We demonstrate the utility of EMBEDR in the context of several data sets and DR algorithms, illustrating its robustness and flexibility as well as its potential for making rigorous, quantitative analyses of single-cell omics data. EMBEDR is available as a Python package for immediate use.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks2--4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. Homemade remedies7,8 and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet, as well as dismissals of expert advice9--11. There is a lack of understanding about how this distrust evolves at the system level13,14. Here we provide a map of the contention surrounding vaccines that has emerged from the global pool of around three billion Facebook users. Its core reveals a multi-sided landscape of unprecedented intricacy that involves nearly 100~million individuals partitioned into highly dynamic, interconnected clusters across cities, countries, continents and languages. Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral. Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. Insights provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views. Our results challenge the conventional thinking about undecided individuals in issues of contention surrounding health, shed light on other issues of contention such as climate change11, and highlight the key role of network cluster dynamics in multi-species ecologies15.},

  abstract = {There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.},

  abstract = {Most studies of pattern formation place particular emphasis on its role in the development of complex multicellular body plans. In simpler organisms, however, pattern formation is intrinsic to growth and behavior. Inspired by one such organism, the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we present examples of complex emergent pattern formation and evolution formed by a population of simple particle-like agents. Using simple local behaviors based on chemotaxis, the mobile agent population spontaneously forms complex and dynamic transport networks. By adjusting simple model parameters, maps of characteristic patterning are obtained. Certain areas of the parameter mapping yield particularly complex long term behaviors, including the circular contraction of network lacunae and bifurcation of network paths to maintain network connectivity. We demonstrate the formation of irregular spots and labyrinthine and reticulated patterns by chemoattraction. Other Turing-like patterning schemes were obtained by using chemorepulsion behaviors, including the self-organization of regular periodic arrays of spots, and striped patterns. We show that complex pattern types can be produced without resorting to the hierarchical coupling of reaction-diffusion mechanisms. We also present network behaviors arising from simple pre-patterning cues, giving simple examples of how the emergent pattern formation processes evolve into networks with functional and quasi-physical properties including tensionlike effects, network minimization behavior, and repair to network damage. The results are interpreted in relation to classical theories of biological pattern formation in natural systems, and we suggest mechanisms by which emergent pattern formation processes may be used as a method for spatially represented unconventional computation.},

Design A pragmatic, open plan, parallel group, randomised controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. Setting Two public speech clinics in New Zealand. Participants Stuttering preschool children who presented to the speech clinics for treatment. Inclusion criteria were age 3-6 years and frequency of stuttering of at least 2\% syllables stuttered. Exclusion criteria were onset of stuttering during the six months before recruitment and treatment for stuttering during the previous 12 months. 54 participants were randomised: 29 to the Lidcombe programme arm and 25 to the control arm. 12 of the participants were girls. Intervention Lidcombe programme of early stuttering intervention. Main outcome measures Frequency of stuttering was measured as the proportion of syllables stuttered, from audiotaped recordings of participants' conversational speech outside the clinic. Parents in both arms of the trial collected speech samples in three different speaking situations before randomisation and at three, six, and nine months after randomisation. Results Analysis showed a highly significant difference (P = 0.003) at nine months after randomisation. The mean proportion of syllables stuttered at nine months after randomisation was 1.5\% (SD 1.4) for the treatment arm and 3.9\% (SD 3.5) for the control arm, giving an effect size of 2.3\% of syllables stuttered (95\% confidence interval 0.8 to 3.9). This effect size was more than double the minimum clinically worthwhile difference specified in the trial protocol. Conclusions The results provide evidence from a randomised controlled trial to support early intervention for stuttering. The Lidcombe programme is an efficacious treatment for stuttering in children of preschool age.},

False consciousness is defined as the holding of false beliefs that are contrary to one's social interest and which thereby contribute to the disadvantaged position of the self or the group. It is argued that considerable psychological evidence for false consciousness exists and that a thorough understanding of the phenomenon integrates several lines of research on the problem of political acquiescence. Six basic types of false consciousness are proposed: (1) Failure to perceive injustice and disadvantage, (2) Fatalism, (3) Justification of social roles, (4) False attribution of blame, (5) Identification with the oppressor, and (6) Resistance to change. Because the concept of false consciousness is likely to arouse suspicion because of its Marxian origins, several theoretical and methodological objections to the scientific study of false consciousness are raised and addressed.},

  abstract = {Since the beginnings of historical linguistics, the family tree has been the most widely accepted model for representing historical relations between languages. While this sort of representation is easy to grasp, and allows for a simple, attractive account of the development of a language family, the assumptions made by the tree model are applicable in only a small number of cases: namely, when a speaker population undergoes successive splits, with subsequent loss of contact among subgroups. A tree structure is unsuited for dealing with dialect continua, as well as language families that develop out of dialect continua (for which Ross 1988 uses the term ``linkage''); in these situations, the scopes of innovations (in other words, their isoglosses) are not nested, but rather they persistently intersect, so that any proposed tree representation is met with abundant counterexamples. In this paper, we define ``Historical Glottometry'', a new method capable of identifying and representing genealogical subgroups even when they intersect. Finally, we apply this glottometric method to a specific linkage, consisting of 17 Oceanic languages spoken in northern Vanuatu.},

  abstract = {Genetic variants that inactivate protein-coding genes are a powerful source of information about the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption: genes that are crucial for the function of an organism will be depleted of such variants in natural populations, whereas non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation. However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

  abstract = {The quantification of visual aesthetics and complexity have a long history, the latter previously operationalized via the application of compression algorithms. Here we generalize and extend the compression approach beyond simple complexity measures to quantify algorithmic distance in historical and contemporary visual media. The proposed "ensemble" approach works by compressing a large number of transformed versions of a given input image, resulting in a vector of associated compression ratios. This approach is more efficient than other compression-based algorithmic distances, and is particularly suited for the quantitative analysis of visual artifacts, because human creative processes can be understood as algorithms in the broadest sense. Unlike comparable image embedding methods using machine learning, our approach is fully explainable through the transformations. We demonstrate that the method is cognitively plausible and fit for purpose by evaluating it against human complexity judgments, and on automated detection tasks of authorship and style. We show how the approach can be used to reveal and quantify trends in art historical data, both on the scale of centuries and in rapidly evolving contemporary NFT art markets. We further quantify temporal resemblance to disambiguate artists outside the documented mainstream from those who are deeply embedded in Zeitgeist. Finally, we note that compression ensembles constitute a quantitative representation of the concept of visual family resemblance, as distinct sets of dimensions correspond to shared visual characteristics otherwise hard to pin down. Our approach provides a new perspective for the study of visual art, algorithmic image analysis, and quantitative aesthetics more generally.},

  abstract = {Language change is influenced by many factors, but often starts from synchronic variation, where multiple linguistic patterns or forms coexist, or where different speech communities use language in increasingly different ways. Besides regional or economic reasons, communities may form and segregate based on political alignment. The latter, referred to as political polarization, is of growing societal concern across the world. Here we map and quantify linguistic divergence across the partisan left-right divide in the United States, using social media data. We develop a general methodology to delineate (social) media users by their political preference, based on which (potentially biased) news media accounts they do and do not follow on a given platform. Our data consists of 1.5M short posts by 10k users (about 20M words) from the social media platform Twitter (now "X"). Delineating this sample involved mining the platform for the lists of followers (n=422M) of 72 large news media accounts. We quantify divergence in topics of conversation and word frequencies, messaging sentiment, and lexical semantics of words and emoji. We find signs of linguistic divergence across all these aspects, especially in topics and themes of conversation, in line with previous research. While US American English remains largely intelligible within its large speech community, our findings point at areas where miscommunication may eventually arise given ongoing polarization and therefore potential linguistic divergence. Our methodology - combining data mining, lexicostatistics, machine learning, large language models and a systematic human annotation approach - is largely language and platform agnostic. In other words, while we focus here on US political divides and US English, the same approach is applicable to other countries, languages, and social media platforms.},

  abstract = {Ockham's razor is the characteristic scientific penchant for simpler, more testable, and more unified theories. Glymour's early work on confirmation theory (1980) eloquently stressed the rhetorical plausibility of Ockham's razor in scientific arguments. His subsequent, seminal research on causal discovery (Spirtes et al. 2000) still concerns methods with a strong bias toward simpler causal models, and it also comes with a story about reliability---the methods are guaranteed to converge to true causal structure in the limit. However, there is a familiar gap between convergent reliability and scientific rhetoric: convergence in the long run is compatible with any conclusion in the short run. For that reason, Carnap (1945) suggested that the proper sense of reliability for scientific inference should lie somewhere between short-run reliability and mere convergence in the limit. One natural such concept is straightest possible convergence to the truth, where straightness is explicated in terms of minimizing reversals of opinion (drawing a conclusion and then replacing it with a logically incompatible one) and cycles of opinion (returning to an opinion previously rejected) prior to convergence. We close the gap between scientific rhetoric and scientific reliability by showing (1) that Ockham's razor is necessary for cycle-optimal convergence to the truth, and (2) that patiently waiting for information to resolve conflicts among simplest hypotheses is necessary for reversal-optimal convergence to the truth.},

  abstract = {This essay presents a fully inferentialist-expressivist account of scientific representation. In general, inferentialist approaches to scientific representation argue that the capacity of a model to represent a target system depends on inferences from models to target systems (surrogative inference). Inferentialism is attractive because it makes the epistemic function of models central to their representational capacity. Prior inferentialist approaches to scientific representation, however, have depended on some representational element, such as denotation or representational force. Brandom's Making It Explicit provides a model of how to fully discharge such representational vocabulary, but it cannot be applied directly to scientific representations. Pursuing a strategy parallel to Brandom's, this essay begins with an account of how surrogative inference is justified. Scientific representation and the denotation of model elements are then explained in terms of surrogative inference by treating scientific representation and denotation as expressive, analogous to Brandom's account of truth. The result is a thoroughgoing inferentialism: M is a scientific representation of T if and only if M has scientifically justified surrogative consequences that are answers to questions about T.},

Hence, when we look at linguistic phenomena in corpora, the null hypothesis will never be true. Moreover, where there is enough data, we shall (almost) always be able to establish that it is not true. In corpus studies, we frequently do have enough data, so the fact that a relation between two phenomena is demonstrably non-random, does not support the inference that it is not arbitrary. We present experimental evidence of how arbitrary associations between word frequencies and corpora are systematically non-random. We review literature in which hypothesis testing has been used, and show how it has often led to unhelpful or misleading results.},

Using Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate that a variety of inequality measures---including the Gini coefficient, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, and the percentage of articles ever cited---are substantially biased downward by increases in the total number of articles and citations. We propose and validate a resampling-based correction for this ``marginals bias'' and apply this correction to empirical data on scholarly citation distributions using Web of Science data covering four broad scientific fields (health, humanities, mathematics and the computer sciences, and the social sciences) from 1996 to 2014. We find that in each field the bulk of the apparent decline in citation inequality in recent years is an artifact of marginals bias, as are most apparent interfield differences in citation inequality. Researchers using inequality measures to compare citation distributions and other distributions with many cases at or near the zero-bound should interpret these metrics carefully and account for the influence of changing marginals.},

Due to the lack of a systematic method to map these heterogeneous entities together, each entity has been analyzed in isolation or only through pairwise relationships, inhibiting comprehensive understanding of the whole ecosystem. Here, we introduce \${\textbackslash}textit\{Labor Space\}\$, a vector-space embedding of heterogeneous labor market entities, derived through applying a large language model with fine-tuning. Labor Space exposes the complex relational fabric of various labor market constituents, facilitating coherent integrative analysis of industries, occupations, skills, and firms, while retaining type-specific clustering. We demonstrate its unprecedented analytical capacities, including positioning heterogeneous entities on an economic axes, such as `Manufacturing--Healthcare'. Furthermore, by allowing vector arithmetic of these entities, Labor Space enables the exploration of complex inter-unit relations, and subsequently the estimation of the ramifications of economic shocks on individual units and their ripple effect across the labor market. We posit that Labor Space provides policymakers and business leaders with a comprehensive unifying framework for labor market analysis and simulation, fostering more nuanced and effective strategic decision-making.},

  abstract = {In history the same historical episodes can be reconstructed from multiple perspectives, leading to different interpretations and evaluations of the same events, and sometimes even to different factual claims. In this paper, I analyze what I call ``historiographical pluralism''---situations of conflict between different case studies of the same historical episodes. I address two interrelated questions: First, which features of historical reconstruction and representation give rise to such conflicts? Second, can we assess rival historical case studies and decide between them, thus restricting historiographical pluralism? As an answer to the first question, I highlight the selective and theory-laden character of historical representation and argue that the narrative dimension of historiography is central for the knowledge that a historical case study can convey. I then go on to analyze how---in practice---disagreement about historical facts emerges. I discuss four case studies paired around two historical episodes and show that conflicts arise from the selective, theory-laden, and narrative aspects of historical methodologies. The second question I answer by discussing different criteria for assessing historical accounts. I note a dilemma in the evaluation of historical reconstructions. On the one hand, there exist neutral and almost universally accepted evaluation criteria. But these criteria are weak and cannot always decide between conflicting accounts of the same episodes. On the other hand, there are stronger methodological criteria. Alas, they are often not neutral with respect to the substantial theoretical issues at stake in situations of conflict between different historical reconstructions. I conclude that because of this dilemma, we have to accept some degree of pluralism in historiography.},

He adopts the prejudices of his time in "Beyond Good and Evil", his mature "critique of modernity" in order to demonstrate the self-overcoming of those prejudices. Beyond merely questioning the value of truth, Nietzsche evaluates by the measure of psychological strength, and describes the character of nobility beyond good and evil and beyond truth and falsity.},

The ordering of areas is as follows: mathematics is (arbitrarily) placed at the top of the circle, and is followed clockwise by physics, physical chemistry, engineering, chemistry, earth sciences, biology, biochemistry, infectious diseases, medicine, health services, brain research, psychology, humanities, social sciences, and computer science. The link between computer science and mathematics completes the circle.

The circular map of science is found to have a high level of correspondence with the 20 existing maps, and has a variety of advantages over hierarchical and centric forms. A one-dimensional Riemannian version of the consensus map is also proposed.},

  abstract = {A great deal of work has been done to understand how science contributes to technological innovation and medicine. This is no surprise given the amount of money invested annually in R\&D. However, what is not well known is that U.S. science (R\&D) investment is only one-sixth that of the annual revenue received by non-profit organizations (NPOs) in the U.S. The large majority of NPO revenues are devoted to the remaining landscape of altruistic causes -- those not relying as heavily on scientific inquiry. Given this broader context, one might reasonably expect the non-profit world to have been as well characterized as that of scientific research. The unfortunate truth is that no map of altruistic missions and causes exists; the landscape of altruistic activity is virtually unknown. In this paper, we present the first maps of altruistic mission space. These maps were created using the text from websites of 125,000 non-profit organizations (NPOs) in the U.S. The maps consist of 357 topics covering areas such as religion, education, sports, culture, human services, public policy and medical care. The role of science in this altruistic landscape is examined. Possible applications are discussed.},

First, a method for generating maps directly from the data on the relationships between hundreds of thousands of documents is presented. Second, quantitative techniques for evaluating these large maps of science are introduced. Third, these techniques are applied to data in order to evaluate eight different maps. The analyses suggest that accuracy can be increased by using a modified cosine measure of relatedness. Disciplinary bias can be significantly reduced and accuracy can be further increased by using much lower threshold levels. In short, much larger samples of papers can and should be used to generate more accurate maps of science.},

We classify these into different dimensions including the type of target systems addressed, the intended modeling goals, and the models' degree of abstraction.

Studying the dialectic of chemists'collectively shared goals and tools, I argue thatpaper tools, like laboratory instruments, areresources whose possibilities are not exhausted byscientists' attempts to achieve existing goals, butrather whose applications generate new goals.

We show that this information can be analyzed by measuring the uncertainty (and certainty) contained in paths along nodes and links in a network. Specifically, we derive from first principles a measure known as effective information and describe its behavior in common network models. Networks with higher effective information contain more information in the relationships between nodes. We show how subgraphs of nodes can be grouped into macronodes, reducing the size of a network while increasing its effective information (a phenomenon known as causal emergence). We find that informative higher scales are common in simulated and real networks across biological, social, informational, and technological domains. These results show that the emergence of higher scales in networks can be directly assessed and that these higher scales offer a way to create certainty out of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {$<$} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {$<$} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen's ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({$<$} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

However, in contrast to the earlier philosophical case studies on causal isolation robustness analysis (Weisberg and Reisman in Philos Sci 75:106--131, 2008; Kuorikoski et al. in Br J Philos Sci 61:541--567, 2010), robustness analysis in the circadian clock research did not remain in the level of mathematical modeling, but it combined it with experimentation on model organisms and a new type of model, a synthetic model.},

  abstract = {The epistemic value of models has traditionally been approached from a representational perspective. This paper argues that the artifactual approach evades the problem of accounting for representation and better accommodates the modal dimension of modeling. From an artifactual perspective, models are viewed as erotetic vehicles constrained by their construction and available representational tools. The modal dimension of modeling is approached through two case studies. The first portrays mathematical modeling in economics, while the other discusses the modeling practice of synthetic biology, which exploits and combines models in various modes and media. Neither model intends to represent any actual target system. Rather, they are constructed to study possible mechanisms through the construction of a model system with built-in dependencies.},

We argue that if we are to understand how models function in the actual scientific practice the representational approach to models proves either misleading or too minimal---depending on how representation is defined. By `representational approach' we mean one that attributes the epistemic value of models to the representational relationship between a model and some real target system. In contrast we propose turning from the representational approach to the artefactual, which also implies a new unit of analysis: the activity of modelling. Modelling, we suggest, could fruitfully be approached as a scientific practice in which concrete artefacts, i.e., models, are constructed with specific representational means and used in various ways, for example, for the purposes of scientific reasoning, theory construction and design of experiments and other artefacts. Furthermore, we propose that in the activity of modelling the construction of models is intertwined with the construction of new phenomena, concepts, and theoretical principles. We will illustrate these claims by studying the construction of the ideal heat engine by Sadi Carnot.},

We examine e using the mechanistic philosophy of science as an analytic springboard e the transfer of network methods from engineering to biology through the cases of two biology laboratories operating at the California Institute of Technology. The two laboratories study gene regulatory networks, but in remarkably different ways. The research strategy of the Davidson lab fits squarely into the traditional mechanist philosophy in its aim to decompose and reconstruct, in detail, gene regulatory networks of a chosen model organism. In contrast, the Elowitz lab constructs minimal models that do not attempt to represent any particular naturally evolved genetic circuits. Instead, it studies the principles of gene regulation through a templatebased approach that is applicable to any kinds of networks, whether biological or not. We call for the mechanists to consider whether the latter approach can be accommodated by the mechanistic approach, and what kinds of modifications it would imply for the mechanistic paradigm of explanation, if it were to address modelling more generally.},

We argue, instead, that many computational models cannot easily be conceived of in representational terms. Rather, they can be seen as models for various epistemic endeavors. Apart from dealing with the question of representation, we discuss also what implications the genuinely cross-disciplinary computational templates such as neural networks have for the organization of science.

In this paper, we will argue that the actual situation is more nuanced and complex. Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field of research located at the interface of physics, chemistry, biology, and computational science. All of these fields provide concepts, metaphors, mathematical tools, and models, which are typically utilized by synthetic biologists by drawing analogies between the different fields of inquiry. We will study analogical reasoning in synthetic biology through the emergence of the functional meaning of noise, which marks an important shift in how engineering concepts are employed in this field. The notion of noise serves also to highlight the differences between the two branches of synthetic biology: the basic science-oriented branch and the engineering-oriented branch, which differ from each other in the way they draw analogies to various other fields of study. Moreover, we show that fixing the mapping between a source domain and the target domain seems not to be the goal of analogical reasoning in actual scientific practice.},

Common data analysis pipelines include a dimensionality reduction step for visualising the data in two dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this protocol yields superior results compared to the naive application of t-SNE.},

  abstract = {The last several years have seen a growth in the number of publications in economics that use principal component analysis (PCA) in the area of welfare studies. This paper explores the ways discrete data can be incorporated into PCA. The effects of discreteness of the observed variables on the PCA are overviewed. The statistical properties of the popular Filmer \& Pritchett (2001) procedure are analyzed. The concepts of polychoric and polyserial correlations are introduced with appropriate references to the existing literature demonstrating their statistical properties. A large simulation study is carried out to compare various flavors of discrete data PCA. The simulation results show that the currently used method of running PCA on a set of dummy variables as proposed by Filmer \& Pritchett (2001) does not perform as well as other methods for analyzing discrete data, both simple such as using ordinal variables, and more sophisticated such as using the polychoric correlations. An empirical example using Bangladesh 2000 DHS data helps in explaining the differences between procedures.},

Here, using a spatially-explicit agent-based model, we investigate the impact of climatic forcing and violent conflict to account for the observed population patterns. We demonstrate that climate variation during the European Mid-Holocene is unable to explain these cycles. In contrast, density-dependent conflict can produce cyclic demographic patterns with time scales and amplitudes similar to those established from population proxies (radiocarbon dates) in our focus period. These results suggest that inter-group conflict played a crucial role in the demographics of this period.},

Based on the theory of Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology, UMAP is an emerging dimensionality reduction technique that offers better versatility and stability than t-SNE. Although UMAP is also more efficient than t-SNE, it still suffers from an initial delay of a few minutes to produce the first projection, which limits its use in interactive data exploration. To tackle this problem, we improve the sequential computations in UMAP by making them progressive, which allows people to incrementally append a batch of data points into the projection at the desired pace. In our experiment with the Fashion MNIST dataset, we found that Progressive UMAP could generate the first approximate projection within a few seconds while also sufficiently capturing the important structures of the high-dimensional dataset.},

  abstract = {Scientific peer-review and publication systems incur a huge burden in terms of costs and time. Innovative alternatives have been proposed to improve the systems, but assessing their impact in experimental studies is not feasible at a systemic level. We developed an agent-based model by adopting a unified view of peer review and publication systems and calibrating it with empirical journal data in the biomedical and life sciences. We modeled researchers, research manuscripts and scientific journals as agents. Researchers were characterized by their scientific level and resources, manuscripts by their scientific value, and journals by their reputation and acceptance or rejection thresholds. These state variables were used in submodels for various processes such as production of articles, submissions to target journals, in-house and external peer review, and resubmissions. We collected data for a sample of biomedical and life sciences journals regarding acceptance rates, resubmission patterns and total number of published articles. We adjusted submodel parameters so that the agent-based model outputs fit these empirical data. We simulated 105 journals, 25,000 researchers and 410,000 manuscripts over 10~years. A mean of 33,600 articles were published per year; 19~\% of submitted manuscripts remained unpublished. The mean acceptance rate was 21~\% after external peer review and rejection rate 32~\% after in-house review; 15~\% publications resulted from the first submission, 47~\% the second submission and 20~\% the third submission. All decisions in the model were mainly driven by the scientific value, whereas journal targeting and persistence in resubmission defined whether a manuscript would be published or abandoned after one or many rejections. This agent-based model may help in better understanding the determinants of the scientific publication and peer-review systems. It may also help in assessing and identifying the most promising alternative systems of peer review.},

Further, we have discovered that the probability of moving toward the average opinion goes down if the difference between it and the user's opinion is too large. Another interesting feature uncovered is that if a user's opinion and the average opinion of their online friends are very similar, the influence also decreases.},

However, few computational models describe how combinations of stimulus features evoke different emotions. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network that accurately decodes images into 11 distinct emotion categories. We validate the model using more than 25,000 images and movies and show that image content is sufficient to predict the category and valence of human emotion ratings. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we demonstrate that patterns of human visual cortex activity encode emotion category--related model output and can decode multiple categories of emotional experience. These results suggest that rich, category-specific visual features can be reliably mapped to distinct emotions, and they are coded in distributed representations within the human visual system. Human visual cortex contains distributed representations of emotion categories identified by a convolutional neural network model.

  abstract = {ChatGPT is not only fun to chat with, but it also searches information, answers questions, and gives advice. With consistent moral advice, it can improve the moral judgment and decisions of users. Unfortunately, ChatGPT's advice is not consistent. Nonetheless, it does influence users' moral judgment, we find in an experiment, even if they know they are advised by a chatting bot, and they underestimate how much they are influenced. Thus, ChatGPT corrupts rather than improves its users' moral judgment. While these findings call for better design of ChatGPT and similar bots, we also propose training to improve users' digital literacy as a remedy. Transparency, however, is not sufficient to enable the responsible use of AI.},

We propose a new graph layout method, tsNET, based on representing a graph with a distance matrix, which together with a modified t-SNE cost function results in desirable layouts. We evaluate our method by a formal comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both visually and via established quality metrics on a comprehensive benchmark, containing real-world and synthetic graphs. As evidenced by the quality metrics and visual inspection, tsNET produces excellent layouts.},

In contrast, the epistemic importance of robustness analysis is easy to explicate if modelling is viewed as extended cognition, as inference from assumptions to conclusions. Robustness analysis is about assessing the reliability of our extended inferences, and when our confidence in these inferences changes, so does our confidence in the results. Furthermore, we argue that Sugden's inductive account relies tacitly on robustness considerations.},

Whereas the economics models aim at unification, the sociological models aim at a set of mechanism schemas that are extrapolatable to the extent that the underlying psychological mechanisms are general. These conceptions of generality induce specific biases in mechanistic explanation and are related to different views of when knowledge from different fields should be seen as relevant.},

However, it is not clear how confidence varies with knowledge. Here, we examine four large surveys, spanning 30\,years in Europe and the United States and propose a new confidence metric. This metric does not rely on self-reporting or peer comparison, operationalizing (over)confidence as the tendency to give incorrect answers rather than `don't know' responses to questions on scientific facts. We find a nonlinear relationship between knowledge and confidence, with overconfidence (the confidence gap) peaking at intermediate levels of actual scientific knowledge. These high-confidence/intermediate-knowledge groups also display the least positive attitudes towards science. These results differ from current models and, by identifying specific audiences, can help inform science communication strategies.},

  abstract = {Policy and guideline proposals for ethical artificial intelligence research have proliferated in recent years. These are supposed to guide the socially-responsible development of AI for a common good. However, there typically exist incentives for non-cooperation (i.e., non-adherence to such policies and guidelines); and, these proposals often lack effective mechanisms to enforce their own normative claims. The situation just described constitutes a social dilemma---namely, a situation where no one has an individual incentive to cooperate, though mutual cooperation would lead to the best outcome for all involved. In this paper, we use stochastic evolutionary game dynamics to model this social dilemma in the context of the ethical development of artificial intelligence. This formalism allows us to isolate variables that may be intervened upon, thus providing actionable suggestions for increased cooperation amongst numerous stakeholders in AI. Our results show how stochastic effects can help make cooperation viable in such a scenario. They suggest that coordination for a common good should be attempted in smaller groups in which the cost of cooperation is low, and the perceived risk of failure is high. This provides insight into the conditions under which we should expect such ethics proposals to be successful with regard to their scope, scale, and content.},

  abstract = {Due to the strong overreliance on p-values in the scientific literature some researchers have argued that p-values should be abandoned or banned, and that we need to move beyond p-values and embrace practical alternatives. When proposing alternatives to p-values statisticians often commit the `Statistician's Fallacy', where they declare which statistic researchers really `want to know'. Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask. In some situations, the answer to the question they are most interested in will be the p-value. As long as null-hypothesis tests have been criticized, researchers have suggested to include minimum-effect tests and equivalence tests in our statistical toolbox, and these tests (even though they return p-values) have the potential to greatly improve the questions researchers ask. It is clear there is room for improvement in how we teach p-values. If anyone really believes p-values are an important cause of problems in science, preventing the misinterpretation of p-values by developing better evidence-based education and user-centered statistical software should be a top priority. Telling researchers which statistic they should use has distracted us from examining more important questions, such as asking researchers what they want to know when they do scientific research. Before we can improve our statistical inferences, we need to improve our statistical questions.}

These instances are sentences in an article that cite other articles. Applying this approach to a collection of more than four million English-language articles published between 2000 and 2015 period, we determine the level of disagreement in five broad fields within the scientific literature (biomedical and health sciences; life and earth sciences; mathematics and computer science; physical sciences and engineering; and social sciences and humanities) and 817 meso-level fields. Overall, the level of disagreement is highest in the social sciences and humanities, and lowest in mathematics and computer science. However, there is considerable heterogeneity across the meso-level fields, revealing the importance of local disciplinary cultures and the epistemic characteristics of disagreement. Analysis at the level of individual articles reveals notable episodes of disagreement in science, and illustrates how methodological artifacts can confound analyses of scientific texts.},

This paper explicitly tackles parameter space exploration and calibration of ABMs combining supervised machine-learning and intelligent sampling to build a surrogate meta-model. The proposed approach provides a fast and accurate approximation of model behaviour, dramatically reducing computation time. In that, our machine-learning surrogate facilitates large scale explorations of the parameter-space, while providing a powerful filter to gain insights into the complex functioning of agent-based models. The algorithm introduced in this paper merges model simulation and output analysis into a surrogate meta-model, which substantially ease ABM calibration. We successfully apply our approach to the Brock and Hommes (1998) asset pricing model and to the ``Island'' endogenous growth model (Fagiolo and Dosi, 2003). Performance is evaluated against a relatively large out-of-sample set of parameter combinations, while employing different user-defined statistical tests for output analysis. The results demonstrate the capacity of machine learning surrogates to facilitate fast and precise exploration of agent-based models' behaviour over their often rugged parameter spaces.},

The Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) model is composed of heterogeneous firms belonging to capital-good, consumption-good and energy sectors. Production and energy generation lead to greenhouse gas emissions, which affect temperature dynamics. Climate damages are modelled at the individual level as stochastic shocks hitting workers' labour productivity, energy efficiency, capital stock and inventories of firms. In that, aggregate damages emerge from the aggregation of losses suffered by heterogeneous, interacting and boundedly rational agents. The model is run focusing on a business-as-usual carbon-intensive scenario consistent with a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. We find that the DSK model is able to account for a wide ensemble of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning both economic and climate dynamics. Simulation experiments show a substantial lack of isomorphism between the effects of micro- and macro-level shocks, as it is typical in complex system models. In particular, different types of shocks have heterogeneous impact on output growth, unemployment rate, and the likelihood of economic crises, pointing to the importance of the different economic channel affected by the shock. Overall, we report much larger climate damages than those projected by standard IAMs under comparable scenarios, suggesting possible shifts in the growth dynamics, from a self-sustained pattern to stagnation and high volatility, and the need of urgent policy interventions.},

Participants' educational attainment, SES, and occupation-related prestige were associated with the experience of EA. For example, lower SES was associated with higher perceived instability, with more experienced CLEs mediating this relationship.

In Study 2, interview data from emerging adults with low educational attainment who were engaged in vocational training (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 12) were analyzed.

This essay offers some examples of proofs that mathematicians have considered explanatory (or not), and it argues that these examples suggest a particular account of explanation in mathematics (at least, of those explanations consisting of proofs). The essay compares its account to Steiner's and Kitcher's. Among the topics that arise are proofs that exploit symmetries, mathematical coincidences, brute-force proofs, simplicity in mathematics, merely clever proofs, and proofs that unify what other proofs treat as separate cases.},

The central issue is taken to be how to distinguish between two types of mathematical proofs: those that explain why what they prove is true and those that merely prove theorems without explaining why they are true. This way of framing the issue neglects the possibility of mathematical explanations that are not proofs at all. This paper addresses what it would take for a non-proof to explain. The paper focuses on a particular example of an explanatory non-proof: an argument that mathematicians regard as explaining why a given theorem holds regarding the derivative of an infinite sum of differentiable functions. The paper contrasts this explanatory non-proof with various non-explanatory proofs (and non-explanatory nonproofs) of the same theorem. The paper offers an account of what makes the given non-proof explanatory.

Traditional scientific publishing,  that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There  are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50~years. At the same time publication using new channels,  for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller  than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature.  There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest  growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives  and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has  only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements  of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge  it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and  citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and  indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely  on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes  the use of this source.  {$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Human sexual dimorphism has been widely misunderstood. A large literature has underestimated the effect of differences in body composition and the role of male contest competition for mates. It is often assumed that sexually dimorphic traits reflect a history of sexual selection, but natural selection frequently builds different phenotypes in males and females. The relatively small sex difference in stature ({$\sim$}7\%) and its decrease during human evolution have been widely presumed to indicate decreased male contest competition for mates. However, females likely increased in stature relative to males in order to successfully deliver large-brained neonates through a bipedally-adapted pelvis. Despite the relatively small differences in stature and body mass ({$\sim$}16\%), there are marked sex differences in body composition. Across multiple samples from groups with different nutrition, males typically have 36\% more lean body mass, 65\% more muscle mass, and 72\% more arm muscle than women, yielding parallel sex differences in strength. These sex differences in muscle and strength are comparable to those seen in primates where sexual selection, arising from aggressive male mating competition, has produced high levels of dimorphism. Body fat percentage shows a reverse pattern, with females having {$\sim$}1.6 times more than males and depositing that fat in different body regions than males. We argue that these sex differences in adipose arise mainly from natural selection on women to accumulate neurodevelopmental resources.},

It is a remarkable argument for understanding the reality of science in practical terms. In this book Latour, identified by Richard Rorty as the new "b{\^e}te noire of the science worshipers," gives us his most philosophically informed book since Science in Action. Through case studies of scientists in the Amazon analyzing soil and in Pasteur's lab studying the fermentation of lactic acid, he shows us the myriad steps by which events in the material world are transformed into items of scientific knowledge. Through many examples in the world of technology, we see how the material and human worlds come together and are reciprocally transformed in this process. Why, Latour asks, did the idea of an independent reality, free of human interaction, emerge in the first place? His answer to this question, harking back to the debates between Might and Right narrated by Plato, points to the real stakes in the so-called science wars: the perplexed submission of ordinary people before the warring forces of claimants to the ultimate truth.},

To make their analyses of the literature more thorough, some have begun to use computational methods from the digital humanities (DH). Yet this creates a tension: it's become a truism in science studies that the contents of scientific publications do not accurately reflect the complex realities of scientific investigation. In this paper, we outline existing views on how scientific publications fit into the broader picture of science as a system of practices, and find that none of these views exclude articles as valuable sources for philosophical inquiry. Far from ignoring the gap between texts and practice, proper use of DH tools requires, and can even contribute to, our understanding of that gap and its implications.},

  abstract = {Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image superresolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4{\texttimes} upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.},

Current in vivo methods rely on clustering of specified features of extracellular waveforms to identify putative cell types, but these capture only a small amount of variation. Here, we develop a new method (WaveMAP) that combines non-linear dimensionality reduction with graph clustering to identify putative cell types. We apply WaveMAP to extracellular waveforms recorded from dorsal premotor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a decision-making task. Using WaveMAP, we robustly establish eight waveform clusters and show that these clusters recapitulate previously identified narrow- and broad-spiking types while revealing previously unknown diversity within these subtypes. The eight clusters exhibited distinct laminar distributions, characteristic firing rate patterns, and decision-related dynamics. Such insights were weaker when using feature-based approaches. WaveMAP therefore provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of cell types in cortical circuits.},

As an alternative to projections on linear subspaces, nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also known as manifold learning, can provide data representations that preserve structural properties such as pairwise distances or local neighborhoods. Very recently, similarity preservation emerged as a new paradigm for dimensionality reduction, with methods such as stochastic neighbor embedding and its variants. Experimentally, these methods significantly outperform the more classical methods based on distance or transformed distance preservation. This paper explains both theoretically and experimentally the reasons for these performances. In particular, it details (i) why the phenonomenon of distance concentration is an impediment towards efficient dimensionality reduction and (ii) how SNE and its variants circumvent this difficulty by using similarities that are invariant to shifts with respect to squared distances. The paper also proposes a generalized definition of shift-invariant similarities that extend the applicability of SNE to noisy data.},

  abstract = {Dimensionality reduction aims at providing faithful low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. Its general principle is to attempt to reproduce in a low-dimensional space the salient characteristics of data, such as proximities. A large variety of methods exist in the literature, ranging from principal component analysis to deep neural networks with a bottleneck layer. In this cornucopia, it is rather difficult to find out why a few methods clearly outperform others. This paper identifies two important properties that enable some recent methods like stochastic neighborhood embedding and its variants to produce improved visualizations of high-dimensional data. The first property is a low sensitivity to the phenomenon of distance concentration. The second one is plasticity, that is, the capability to forget about some data characteristics to better reproduce the other ones. In a manifold learning perspective, breaking some proximities typically allow for a better unfolding of data. Theoretical developments as well as experiments support our claim that both properties have a strong impact. In particular, we show that equipping classical methods with the missing properties significantly improves their results.},

It is intended to be accessible to undergraduate students who have successfully completed a regression course. Even though there is no mathematical prerequisite, we still introduce fairly sophisticated topics such as likelihood theory, zero-inflated Poisson, and parametric bootstrapping in an intuitive and applied manner. We believe strongly in case studies featuring real data and real research questions; thus, most of the data in the textbook arises from collaborative research conducted by the authors and their students, or from student projects. Our goal is that, after working through this material, students will develop an expanded toolkit and a greater appreciation for the wider world of data and statistical modeling.},

  abstract = {We extend the study of a computational model recently proposed for the mammalian circadian clock (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100 (2003) 7051). The model, based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, BmalI and Clock genes, can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in conditions of continuous darkness. These limit cycle oscillations correspond to circadian rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei and by sonic peripheral tissues. By using different sets of parameter values producing circadian oscillations, we compare the effect of the various parameters and show that both the occurrence and the period of the oscillations are generally most sensitive to parameters related to synthesis or degradation of BmalI rnRNA and BMAL1 protein. The mechanism of circadian oscillations relies on the formation of an inactive complex between PER and CRY and the activators CLOCK and BMAL1 that enhance Per and Cry expression. Bifurcation diagrams and computer simulations nevertheless indicate the possible existence of a second source of oscillatory behavior. Thus, sustained oscillations might arise from the sole negative autoregulation of BmalI expression. This second oscillatory mechanism may not be functional in physiological conditions, and its period need not necessarily be circadian. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark (LD) cycles. Long-term suppression of circadian oscillations by a single light pulse can occur in the model when a stable steady state coexists with a stable limit cycle. The phase of the oscillations upon entrainment in LD critically depends on the parameters that govern the level of CRY protein. Small changes in the parameters governing CRY levels can shift the peak in Per rnRNA from the L to the D phase, or can prevent entrainment. The results are discussed in relation to physiological disorders of the sleep-wake cycle linked to perturbations of the human circadian clock, such as the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome or the non-24 h sleep-wake syndrome.

Experimentation and modeling, it is argued, build an explorative cooperation. Experimental practice (in the ordinary sense) is bound up with adjustments such as calibrating instruments. With simulation, they become essential to mathematical modeling, as well. Atmospheric circulation models are discussed as an illustrating case.},

First, on the side of instrumentation, small computers and a networked infrastructure took over the lead from centralized mainframe architecture. Second, a new conception of computational modeling became feasible and assumed a crucial role. And third, the field of computational quantum chemistry became organized in a market-like fashion and this market is much bigger than the number of quantum theory experts. These claims will be substantiated by an investigation of the so-called density functional theory (DFT), the arguably pivotal theory in the turn to computational quantum chemistry around 1990.},

Such interactions combine the impressive human powers of comprehension in the visual dimension with the computational capacities of digital machines.

Simulation-based approaches simulate the model repeatedly in search of a set of parameters that generates data similar enough to the observed one. In contrast, likelihood-based approaches derive a likelihood function that connects the unknown parameters to the observed data in a statistically principled way. We compare these two approaches on the well-known bounded-confidence model of opinion dynamics. We do so on three realistic scenarios of increasing complexity depending on data availability: ({$i$}) fully observed opinions and interactions, ({$ii$}) partially observed interactions, ({$iii$}) observed interactions with noisy proxies of the opinions. We highlight how identifying observed and latent variables is fundamental for connecting the model to the data. To realize the likelihood-based approach, we first cast the model into a probabilistic generative guise that supports a proper data likelihood. Then, we describe the three scenarios via probabilistic graphical models and show the nuances that go into translating the model. Finally, we implement the resulting probabilistic models in an automatic differentiation framework (PyTorch). This step enables easy and efficient maximum likelihood estimation via gradient descent. Our experimental results show that the maximum likelihood estimates are up to 4{\texttimes} more accurate and require up to 200{\texttimes} less computational time.},

Here, we reevaluate this approach and show that the linear intrinsic dimensionality of this global map is higher than previously reported. Furthermore, we analyze in which cases PCA fails to detect biologically relevant information and point the reader to methods that overcome these limitations. Our results refine the current understanding of the overall structure of gene expression spaces and show that PCA critically depends on the effect size of the biological signal as well as on the fraction of samples containing this signal.},

It is imperative for data scientists to spend time and resources scoping, scrutinizing, and questioning the possible scenarios of use of their work---particularly given the fast-paced knowledge production required by an emergency situation such as the coronavirus pandemic. In this article I provide a scaffold for such considerations by identifying five ways in which the data science contributions to the pandemic response are imagined and projected into the future, and reflecting on how such imaginaries inform current allocations of investment and priorities within and beyond the scientific research landscape. The first two of these imaginaries, which consist of (1) population surveillance and (2) predictive modeling, have dominated the first wave of governmental and scientific responses, with potentially problematic implications for both research and society. Placing more emphasis on the latter three imaginaries, which include (3) causal explanation, (4) evaluation of logistical decisions, and (5) identification of social and environmental need, I argue, would provide a more balanced, sustainable, and responsible avenue toward using data science to support human coexistence with coronavirus.},

As in many other domains, the opportunity to mine social media for information has been hailed as transformative for research on well-being and disease. Considerations around the fairness, responsibilities and accountabilities relating to using such data have often been set aside, on the understanding that as long as data were anonymised, no real ethical or scientific issue would arise. We first counter this perception by emphasising that the use of social media data in health research can yield problematic and unethical results. We then provide a conceptualisation of methodological data fairness that can complement data management principles such as FAIR by enhancing the actionability of social media data for future research. We highlight the forms that methodological data fairness can take at different stages of the research process and identify practical steps through which researchers can ensure that their practices and outcomes are scientifically sound as well as fair to society at large. We conclude that making research data fair as well as FAIR is inextricably linked to concerns around the adequacy of data practices. The failure to act on those concerns raises serious ethical, methodological and epistemic issues with the knowledge and evidence that are being produced.},

A variational EM algorithm is derived for dealing with the optimisation of the hyper-parameters along with the hyper-posteriors' estimation of latent variables and processes. We establish explicit formulas for integrating the mean processes and the latent clustering variables within a predictive distribution, accounting for uncertainty on both aspects. This distribution is defined as a mixture of cluster-specific GP predictions, which enhances the performances when dealing with group-structured data. The model handles irregular grid of observations and offers different hypotheses on the covariance structure for sharing additional information across tasks. The performances on both clustering and prediction tasks are assessed through various simulated scenarios and real datasets.

The common mean process is defined as a GP for which the hyper-posterior distribution is tractable. Therefore an EM algorithm is derived for handling both hyper-parameters optimisation and hyper-posterior computation. Unlike previous approaches in the literature, the model fully accounts for uncertainty and can handle irregular grids of observations while maintaining explicit formulations, by modelling the mean process in a unified GP framework. Predictive analytical equations are provided, integrating information shared across tasks through a relevant prior mean. This approach greatly improves the predictive performances, even far from observations, and may reduce significantly the computational complexity compared to traditional multi-task GP models. Our overall algorithm is called Magma (standing for Multi tAsk GPs with common MeAn). The quality of the mean process estimation, predictive performances, and comparisons to alternatives are assessed in various simulated scenarios and on real datasets.},

Exploratory factor analysis leads us to opt for a fourteen-factor solution. This solution can easily be interpreted as the disciplinary structure of science. The nested maps of science (corresponding to 14 factors, 172 categories, and 6,164 journals) are brought online at http://www.leydesdorff.net/map06/index.htm. An analysis of interdisciplinary relations is pursued at three levels of aggregation using the newly added ISI subject category of ``Nanoscience \& nanotechnology.'' The journal level provides the finer grained perspective. Errors in the attribution of journals to the ISI subject categories are averaged out so that the factor analysis can reveal the main structures. The mapping of science can, therefore, be comprehensive at the level of ISI subject categories.},

Our findings identified a trend towards longer titles with higher lexical density, an increasing preference for compound constructions over nominal-group and full sentence constructions, and a more prevalent presentation of information about research method/design in addition to the topic in titles over the past four decades. These findings suggest that research article titles published in the journal appear to be diachronically more informative.},

In BART and T5 transformer language models, we identify contextual word representations that function as models of entities and situations as they evolve throughout a discourse. These neural representations have functional similarities to linguistic models of dynamic semantics: they support a linear readout of each entity's current properties and relations, and can be manipulated with predictable effects on language generation. Our results indicate that prediction in pretrained neural language models is supported, at least in part, by dynamic representations of meaning and implicit simulation of entity state, and that this behavior can be learned with only text as training data.

  abstract = {The recent rise in digitized historical text has made it possible to quantitatively study our psychological past. This involves understanding changes in what words meant, how words were used, and how these changes may have responded to changes in the environment, such as in healthcare, wealth disparity, and war. Here we make available a tool, the Macroscope, for studying historical changes in language over the last two centuries. The Macroscope uses over 155 billion words of historical text, which will grow as we include new historical corpora, and derives word properties from frequency-of-usage and co-occurrence patterns over time. Using co-occurrence patterns, the Macroscope can track changes in semantics, allowing researchers to identify semantically stable and unstable words in historical text and providing quantitative information about changes in a word's valence, arousal, and concreteness, as well as information about new properties, such as semantic drift. The Macroscope provides information about both the local and global properties of words, as well as information about how these properties change over time, allowing researchers to visualize and download data in order to make inferences about historical psychology. Although quantitative historical psychology represents a largely new field of study, we see this work as complementing a wealth of other historical investigations, offering new insights and new approaches to understanding existing theory. The Macroscope is available online at http://www.macroscope.tech.},

Social media provides the vehicle for these opinions and enables the spread of ideas faster than ever before. Previous computational models have suggested that significant external events can induce extreme polarization. We introduce the Social Opinion Amplification Model (SOAM) to investigate an alternative hypothesis: that opinion amplification can result in extreme polarization. SOAM models effects such as sensationalism, hype, or ``fake news'' as people express amplified versions of their actual opinions, motivated by the desire to gain a greater following. We show for the first time that this simple idea results in extreme polarization, especially when the degree of amplification is small. We further show that such extreme polarization can be prevented by two methods: preventing individuals from amplifying more than five times, or through consistent dissemination of balanced opinions to the population. It is natural to try and have the loudest voice in a crowd when we seek attention; this work suggests that instead of shouting to be heard and generating an uproar, it is better for all if we speak with moderation.},

This is generally viewed as taking place in two stages: first, an ``older German historical school'' that began to question the accepted dogmas of Smithian economics beginning in the 1840s, with the work of Wilhelm Roscher, Bruno Hildebrand, and Karl Knies. This allegedly preceded the ``younger historical school'' of the 1870s and after, dominated by Gustav Schomoller, Lujo Brentano, and Georg Friedrich Knapp. In calling the existence of this older school a myth, I want to draw on the currently fashionable connotation of the word ``myth'': to say, in other words, that this received notion contains some important elements of truth---but masked in such a way as to distort its significance.},

Studying this aspect of cross-disciplinary transfer of knowledge objects, philosophers of science have weighed in on the question of whether knowledge about how a mathematical model is previously applied in one discipline is necessary for the success of reapplying said model in a different discipline. However, not much has been said about whether the answer to that epistemological question applies to the reapplication of a modeling framework. More generally, regarding the nature of the production of knowledge in science, a metaphysical question remains to be explored whether historical contingencies associated with a mathematical construct have a genuine impact on the nature---as opposed to sociological practices or individual psychology---of advancing scientific knowledge with said construct. Focusing on this metaphysical question, this paper analyzes the use of mathematical logic in the development of the Chomsky hierarchy and subsequent reapplications of said hierarchy; with these examples, this paper develops the notion of ``spillovers'' as a way to detect cross-disciplinary justifications for better understanding the relations between reapplications of the same mathematical construct across disciplines.},

  abstract = {Mathematics is one of humanity's most successful yet puzzling endeavors. It is a model of precision and objectivity, but appears distinct from the empirical sciences because it seems to deliver nonexperiential knowledge of a nonphysical reality of numbers, sets, and functions. How can these two aspects of mathematics be reconciled? This concise book provides a systematic yet accessible introduction to the field that is trying to answer that question: the philosophy of mathematics. Written by {\O}ystein Linnebo, one of the world's leading scholars on the subject, the book introduces all of the classical approaches to the field, including logicism, formalism, intuitionism, empiricism, and structuralism. It also contains accessible introductions to some more specialized issues, such as mathematical intuition, potential infinity, the iterative conception of sets, and the search for new mathematical axioms. The groundbreaking work of German mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege, one of the founders of analytic philosophy, figures prominently throughout the book. Other important thinkers whose work is introduced and discussed include Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, David Hilbert, Kurt G{\"o}del, W. V. Quine, Paul Benacerraf, and Hartry H. Field. Sophisticated but clear and approachable, this is an essential introduction for all students and teachers of philosophy, as well as mathematicians and others who want to understand the foundations of mathematics.--},

  abstract = {Modern advances in transportation and communication technology from airplanes to the internet alongside global expansions of media, migration, and trade have made the modern world more connected than ever before. But what does this bode for the convergence of global culture? Here we explore the relationship between centralization in social networks and contraction or collapse in the diversity of semantic expressions such as ideas, opinions and tastes. We advance formal examination of this relationship by introducing new methods of manifold learning that allow us to map social networks and semantic combinations into comparable hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic representations natively represent both hierarchy and diversity within a system. In a Poincar{\'e} disk---a two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding---radius from center traces the position of an actor in a social hierarchy or an idea in a semantic hierarchy. Angle of the disk required to inscribe connected actors or ideas captures their diversity. We illustrate this method by examining the relationship between social centralization and semantic diversity within 21st Century physics, empirically demonstrating how dense, centralized collaboration is associated with a reduction in the space of ideas and how these patterns generalize to all modern scholarship and science. We discuss the complex of causes underlying this association, and theorize the dynamic interplay between structural centralization and semantic contraction, arguing that it introduces an essential tension between the supply and demand of difference.},

The user can be guided by the local intrinsic dimensionality of the high-dimensional data to define seed locations, from which a flood-fill algorithm identifies transcriptomically similar cells on the fly, based on the high-dimensional data topology. In several use cases, we demonstrate that the spatial projection of these flooded cells highlights tissue architectural features and that interactive retrieval of gene expression gradients in the spatial and transcriptomic domains confirms known biology. We also show that SpaceWalker generalizes to several different ST protocols and scales well to large, multi-slice, 3D whole-brain ST data while maintaining real-time interaction performance.},

I further illustrate the usefulness of this framework by applying it to some salient philosophical questions: (1) Is there a linear hierarchy of levels, with a fundamental level at the bottom? And what does the answer to this question imply for physicalism, the thesis that everything supervenes on the physical? (2) Are there emergent properties? (3) Are higher-level descriptions reducible to lower-level ones? (4) Can the relationship between normative and non-normative domains be viewed as one involving levels? Although I use the terminology of ``levels'', the proposed framework can also represent ``scales'', ``domains'', or ``subject matters'', where these are not linearly but only partially ordered by relations of supervenience or inclusion.},

We characterize the dividing line between phenomena requiring nonreductionistic explanation and phenomena permitting individualistic explanation and give examples from the study of ethnic conflicts, social-network theory, and international-relations theory.},

In this paper, we introduce and investigate a generative model of network evolution that reproduces all four pairwise community types that exist in directed networks: assortative, core-periphery, disassortative, and the newly introduced source-basin type. We fix the number of nodes and the community membership of each node, allowing node connectivity to change through rewiring mechanisms that depend on the community membership of the involved nodes. We determine the dependence of the community relationship on the model parameters using a mean-field solution. It reveals that a difference in the swap probabilities of the two communities is a necessary condition to obtain a core-periphery relationship and that a difference in the average in-degree of the communities is a necessary condition for a source-basin relationship. More generally, our analysis reveals multiple possible scenarios for the transition between the different structure types, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the observation of the different types of communities in network data.},

While existing theoretical investigations have provided valuable insights, the intricate and multifaceted nature of modern science hinders the implementation of empirical experiments. This study leverages advancements in Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to investigate the patterns and dynamic mechanisms of topic-transition among scientists. By constructing the knowledge space across 6 large-scale disciplines, we depict the trajectories of scientists' topic transitions within this space, measuring the flow and distance of research regions across different sub-spaces. Our findings reveal a predominantly conservative pattern of topic transition at the individual level, with scientists primarily exploring local knowledge spaces. Furthermore, simulation modeling analysis identifies research intensity, driven by the concentration of scientists within a specific region, as the key facilitator of topic transition. Conversely, the knowledge distance between fields serves as a significant barrier to exploration. Notably, despite potential opportunities for breakthrough discoveries at the intersection of subfields, empirical evidence suggests that these opportunities do not exert a strong pull on scientists, leading them to favor familiar research areas. Our study provides valuable insights into the exploration dynamics of scientific knowledge production, highlighting the influence of individual cognition, social factors, and the intrinsic structure of the knowledge landscape itself. These findings offer a framework for understanding and potentially shaping the course of scientific progress.},

Furthermore it is also important to allocate finite resources to research topics that have growth potential, to accelerate the process from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analysing the APS publication data set from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks, use the Louvain method to detect topical clusters (TCs) in each year, measure the similarity of TCs in consecutive years, and visualize the results as alluvial diagrams. Having the predictive features describing a given TC and its known evolution in the next year, we can train a machine learning model to predict future changes of TCs, i.e., their continuing, dissolving, merging and splitting. We found the number of papers from certain journals, the degree, closeness, and betweenness to be the most predictive features. Additionally, betweenness increases significantly for merging events, and decreases significantly for splitting events. Our results represent a first step from a descriptive understanding of the Science of Science (SciSci), towards one that is ultimately prescriptive.},

  abstract = {In the name of meritocracy, modern economies devote increasing amounts of resources to quantifying and ranking the performance of individuals and organizations. Rankings send out powerful signals, which lead to identifying the actions of top performers as the `best practices' that others should also adopt. However, several studies have shown that the imitation of best practices often leads to a drop in performance. So, should those lagging behind in a ranking imitate top performers or should they instead pursue a strategy of their own? I tackle this question by numerically simulating a stylized model of a society whose agents seek to climb a ranking either by imitating the actions of top performers or by randomly trying out different actions, i.e. via serendipity. The model gives rise to a rich phenomenology, showing that the imitation of top performers increases welfare overall, but at the cost of higher inequality. Indeed, the imitation of top performers turns out to be a self-defeating strategy that consolidates the early advantage of a few lucky---and not necessarily talented---winners, leading to a very unequal, homogenized and effectively non-meritocratic society. Conversely, serendipity favours meritocratic outcomes and prevents rankings from freezing.},

Much debate has been focused on whether top-down causation is coherent or in conflict with reductionism. Less attention has been given to the question of whether these representations of hierarchical relations pick out a single, common hierarchy. A negative answer to this question undermines a commonplace view that the world is divided into stratified `levels' of organization and suggests that attributions of causal responsibility in different hierarchical representations may not have a meaningful basis for comparison. Representations used in top-down and bottom-up explanations are primarily `local' and tied to distinct domains of science, illustrated here by protein structure and folding. This locality suggests that no single metaphysical account of hierarchy for causal relations to obtain within emerges from the epistemology of scientific explanation. Instead, a pluralist perspective is recommended---many different kinds of top-down causation (explanation) can exist alongside many different kinds of bottom-up causation (explanation). Pluralism makes plausible why different senses of top-down causation can be coherent and not in conflict with reductionism, thereby illustrating a productive interface between philosophical analysis and scientific inquiry.},

  abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. Objective: The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world's largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non--mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods: We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories ``economic stress,'' ``isolation,'' and ``home,'' while others such as ``motion'' significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety ({$\rho$}=--0.96, P\&lt;.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged. Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests.},

In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions. All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis.},

  abstract = {The advent of Online Social Networks (OSNs) has offered the opportunity to study the dynamics of information spread and influence propagation at a huge scale. Considerable research has focused on the social influence phenomenon and its impact on OSNs. Social influence plays a crucial role in shaping people behavior and affecting human decisions in various domains. In this paper, we study the impact of social influence on offline dynamics to study human real-life behavior. We introduce Social Influence Deep Learning (SIDL), a framework that combines deep learning with network science for modeling social influence and predicting human behavior on real-world activities, such as attending an event or visiting a location. We propose different approaches at varying degree of network connectivity with the objective of facing two typical challenges of deep learning: interpretability and scalability. We validate and evaluate our approaches using data from Plancast, an Event-Based Social Network, and Foursquare, a Location-Based Social Network. Finally, we explore the usage of different deep learning architectures, and we discuss the correlation between social influence and users privacy presenting results and some notes of caution about the risks of sharing sensitive data.},

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to argue that ontological choices in scientific practice undermine common formulations of the value-free ideal in science. First, I argue that the truth values of scientific statements depend on ontological choices. For example, statements about entities such as species, race, memory, intelligence, depression, or obesity are true or false relative to the choice of a biological, psychological, or medical ontology. Second, I show that ontological choices often depend on non-epistemic values. On the basis of these premises, I argue that it is often neither possible nor desirable to evaluate scientific statements independently of non-epistemic values. Finally, I suggest that considerations of ontological choices do not only challenge the value-free ideal but also help to specify positive roles of non-epistemic values in an often neglected area of scientific practice.},

As one important application, TDA can be used for data visualization and dimension reduction. We follow the framework of circular coordinate representation, which allows us to perform dimension reduction and visualization for high-dimensional datasets on a torus using persistent cohomology. In this paper, we propose a method to adapt the circular coordinate framework to take into account sparsity in high-dimensional applications. We use a generalized penalty function instead of an L2 penalty in the traditional circular coordinate algorithm. We provide simulation experiments and real data analysis to support our claim that circular coordinates with generalized penalty will accommodate the sparsity in high-dimensional datasets under different sampling schemes while preserving the topological structures.},

We argue that the major obstacle is the difficulty in evaluating a clustering algorithm without taking into account the context: why does the user cluster his data in the first place, and what does he want to do with the clustering afterwards? We argue that clustering should not be treated as an application-independent mathematical problem, but should always be studied in the context of its end-use.  Different techniques to evaluate clustering algorithms have to be developed for different uses of clustering. To simplify this procedure we argue that it will be useful to build a ``taxonomy of clustering problems'' to identify clustering applications which can be treated in a unified way and that such an effort will be more fruitful than attempting the impossible -- developing ``optimal'' domain-independent clustering algorithms or even classifying clustering algorithms in terms of how they work.},

  abstract = {Background: Throughout industrialized countries, tobacco consumption is seen as the predominant driver of both the trend and the extent of gender differences in life expectancy. However, several factors raise doubts to this generalization. We hypothesize that the impact of smoking on the gender gap is context-specific and differs between populations. Methods: We decompose the gender differences in life expectancy into fractions caused by smoking and other non-biological factors for 53 industrialized countries and the period 1955--2009 to assess the significance of smoking among the causes that can be influenced by direct or indirect interference. Results: The trend of the gender gap can indeed be attributed to smoking in most populations of the western world. However, with regard to the overall extent of male excess mortality, smoking is the main driver only in the minority of the studied populations. While the impact of smoking to gender differences in life expectancy declines in all populations, the contribution of other non-biological factors is in most cases higher at the end than at the beginning of the observation period. Conclusions: Over-generalized statements suggesting that smoking is the main driver of the gender gap in all populations can be misleading. The results of this study demonstrate that---regardless of the prevailing effect of smoking---many populations have still remarkable potentials to further narrow their gender gaps in life expectancy. Although measures to further reduce the prevalence of tobacco consumption must be continued, more attention should be directed to the growing importance of other non-biological factors.},

However, it remains unclear how broken detailed balance manifests at macroscopic scales, and how such dynamics support higher-order biological functions. Here we present a framework to quantify broken detailed balance by measuring entropy production in macroscopic systems. We apply our method to the human brain, an organ whose immense metabolic consumption drives a diverse range of cognitive functions. Using whole-brain imaging data, we demonstrate that the brain nearly obeys detailed balance when at rest, but strongly breaks detailed balance when performing physically and cognitively demanding tasks. Using a dynamic Ising model, we show that these large-scale violations of detailed balance can emerge from fine-scale asymmetries in the interactions between elements, a known feature of neural systems. Together, these results suggest that violations of detailed balance are vital for cognition, and provide a general tool for quantifying entropy production in macroscopic systems.},

It therefore has its home in a`possible-worlds' framework for analysing, or at leastparaphrasing, statements about what is possible or necessary., The subject of transworld identity has been highly contentious, evenamong philosophers who accept the legitimacy of talk of possibleworlds. Opinions range from the view that the notion of an identitythat holds between objects in distinct possible worlds is soproblematic as to be unacceptable, to the view that the notion isutterly innocuous, and no more problematic than the uncontroversialclaim that individuals could have existed with somewhat differentproperties. Matters are complicated by the fact that an importantrival to `transworld identity' has been proposed: DavidLewis's counterpart theory, which replaces the claim that anindividual exists in more than one possible world with the claim thatalthough each individual exists in one world only, it has counterpartsin other worlds, where the counterpart relation (based on similarity)does not have the logic of identity. Thus much discussion in this areahas concerned the comparative merits of the transworld identity andcounterpart-theoretic accounts as interpretations, within apossible-worlds framework, of statements of what is possible andnecessary for particular individuals.},

Other conclusions arc that one official will not accept bribes from more than one firm. It is impossible to predict which firm will win the contract. No obvious solution emerges and legal remedies are discounted.

  abstract = {The development of models to capture large-scale dynamics in human history is one of the core contributions of the cliodynamics field. Crucially and most often, these models are assessed by their predictive capability on some macro-scale and aggregated measure, compared to manually curated historical data. We consider the model predicting large-scale complex societies from Turchin et al. (2013), where the evaluation is done on the prediction of ``imperial density'': the relative frequency with which a geographical area belonged to large-scale polities over a certain time window. We implement the model and release both code and data for reproducibility. Furthermore, we assess its behaviour against three historical data sets: the relative size of simulated polities vs historical ones; the spatial correlation of simulated imperial density with historical population density; the spatial correlation of simulated conflict vs historical conflict. At the global level, we show good agreement with the population density (R2{$<$}0.75), and some agreement with historical conflict in Europe (R2{$<$}0.42, a lower result possibly due to historical data bias). Despite being overall good at capturing these important effects, the model currently fails to reproduce the shapes of individual imperial polities. Nonetheless, we discuss a way forward by matching the probabilistic imperial strength from simulations to inferred networked communities from real settlement data.},

Sweden has taken comprehensive measures to decrease this gap across 30 years, and many countries are following a similar path. Yet today only 27\% of faculty with the rank of professor in Sweden are female. A common explanation is that academia is biased against women. According to this hypothesis, women have to reach higher levels of scholarly achievement than men to be appointed to the same academic rank. Publication metrics when attaining the rank of professor were compiled from the Web of Science for samples of the whole population of 1345 professors appointed at the six largest universities in Sweden during a six-year period. Men had significantly more publications and citations in both medicine and in the social sciences, rejecting the hypothesis that women are held to a higher scholarly standard in this context.},

  abstract = {Computational philosophy (CP) aims at investigating many important concepts and problems of the philosophical and epistemological tradition in a new way by taking advantage of information-theoretic, cognitive, and artificial intelligence methodologies. I maintain that the results of computational philosophy meet the classical requirements of some Peircian `pragmatic ambitions'. Indeed, more than a 100 years ago, the American philosopher C.S. Peirce, when working on logical and philosophical problems, suggested the concept of pragmatism(`pragmaticism', in his own words) as a logical criterion to analyze what words and concepts express through their practical meaning. Many words have been spent on creative processes and reasoning, especially in the case of scientific practices. In fact, many philosophers have usually offered a number of ways of construing hypotheses generation, but they aim at demonstrating that the activity of generating hypotheses is paradoxical, obscure, and thus not analyzable. Those descriptions are often so far from Peircian pragmatic prescription and so abstract to result completely unknowable and obscure. To dismiss this tendency and gain interesting insight about the so-called `logic of scientific discovery' we need to build constructive procedures, which could play a role in moving the problem-solving process forward by implementing them in some actual models. The `computational turn' gives us a new way to understand creative processes in a strictly pragmatic sense. In fact, by exploiting artificial intelligence and cognitive science tools, computational philosophy allows us to test concepts and ideas previously conceived only in abstract terms. It is in the perspective of these actual computational models that I find the central role of abduction in the explanation of creative reasoning in science. I maintain that the computational philosophy analysis of model-based and manipulative abduction and of external and epistemic mediators is important not only to delineate the actual practice of abduction, but also to further enhance the development of programs computationally adequate in rediscovering, or discovering for the first time, for example, scientific hypotheses or mathematical theorems. The last part of the paper is devoted to illustrating the problem of the extra-theoretical dimension of reasoning and discovery from the perspective of some mathematical cases derived from calculus and geometry.},

  abstract = {The ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 as the current global concern threatens lives of many people around the world. COVID-19 is highly contagious so that it has infected more than 1,848,439 people until April 14, 2020 and killed more than 117,217 people. The main aim of this study is to develop an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates the spatio-temporal outbreak of COVID-19. The main innovation of this research is investigating the impacts of various strategies of school and educational center closures, heeding social distancing, and office closures on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in Urmia city, Iran. In this research, the outbreak of COVID-19 disease was simulated with the help of ABM so that all agents considered in the ABM along with their attri\- butes and behaviors as well as the environment of the ABM were described. Besides, the transmission of COVID19 between human agents was simulated based on the SEIRD model, and finally, all control strategies applied in Urmia city along with corresponding actions of each control strategy were implemented in the ABM. The results of the ABM indicated that school and educational center closures in Urmia city, reduced the number of infected people by 4.96\% each week on average and 49.61\% in total from February 21 until May 10. Heeding social distancing by 30\% and 70\% of people of Urmia city from March 27, led to decrease the number of infected people by 5.24\% and 10.07\% each week, on average and 31.46\% and 60.44\% in total, respectively, and if 30\% and 70\% of civil servants of Urmia city did not go to work, the number of infected people would be decreased by 3.30\% and 5.25\% each week, on average and 32.98\% and 52.48\% in total from February 21 until May 10, respectively. As a result of this research, heeding social distancing by the majority of people is recommended for Urmia city in the current situation. The main advantages of disease modeling are to investigate how the disease is likely to evolve amongst the population of society and also assess the impacts of control strategies on controlling the outbreak of disease.},

The evolution of melt ponds and their geometrical characteristics determines the albedo of sea ice, a key parameter in climate modeling. However, a theoretical understanding of this evolution, and predictions of geometrical features, have remained elusive. To address this fundamental problem in polar climate science, here we introduce a two dimensional random field Ising model for melt ponds. The ponds are identified as metastable states of the system, where the binary spin variable corresponds to the presence of melt water or ice on the sea ice surface. With only a minimal set of physical parameters, the model predictions agree very closely with observed power law scaling of the pond size distribution and critical length scale where melt ponds undergo a transition in fractal geometry.},

From childhood, medical students who are related to a physician are exposed to the characteristics of a medical career and learn its professional ethics not only in school but also in the family setting. The present paper sought to answer the research question: `How does growing up with a physician influence medical students' perceptions of conflicts of interest in their relationships with industry?' Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was completed by 451 medical students from four Philadelphia medical schools and 554 medical students from Warsaw Medical University during 2013. Medical schools in these two cities were chosen because they are both university cities with similar population sizes. Students who had and who did not have a family member working as a physician were compared using chi-square analysis. Data were analysed for each country separately. Results: For both the US and Poland, there were statistically significant differences (p {$<$} .05) between medical students with a physician as a family member and other students with respect to views regarding relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. In both groups, this difference occurred for three important dimensions: students' relationship with the pharmaceutical industry; students' views on physicians' rights to cooperate with the pharmaceutical industry; trust in the pharmaceutical industry. In the US, students related to a doctor were characterized by more restrictive opinions on all three dimensions than other students (e.g., 27.8\% of the former students vs. 31.4\% of the latter students thought doctors had unrestricted rights to cooperate with the industry). However, the contrary was observed in Poland: students with a physician in the family had less strict views than their colleagues (e.g., 56.8\% of the former vs. 39.7\% of the latter thought that doctors should have unrestricted rights of cooperation). Conclusions: In Poland, a former communist country, physicians transmit a more liberal approach towards collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry to their student relatives than those in the US.},

This pragmatic usefulness has led to its construal as a categorical predicate that can sift out living entities from non-living ones depending on their possessing specific properties---reproduction, metabolism, evolvability etc. In this paper, we argue against this binary construal of life. Using text-mining methods across over 30,000 scientific articles, we defend instead a degrees-of-life view and show how these methods can contribute to experimental philosophy of science and concept explication. We apply topic-modeling algorithms to identify which specific properties are attributed to a target set of entities (bacteria, archaea, viruses, prions, plasmids, phages and the molecule of adenine). Eight major clusters of properties were identified together with their relative relevance for each target entity (two that relate to metabolism and catalysis, one to genetics, one to evolvability, one to structure, and---rather unexpectedly---three that concern interactions with the environment broadly construed). While aligning with intuitions---for instance about viruses being less alive than bacteria---these quantitative results also reveal differential degrees of performance that have so far remained elusive or overlooked. Taken together, these analyses provide a conceptual ``lifeness space'' that makes it possible to move away from a categorical construal of life by empirically assessing the relative lifeness of more-or-less alive entities.},

Yet corpora sometimes include texts in several languages, making it impossible to apply language-specific computational approaches over their entire content. This is the problem we encountered when setting to analyze a philosophy of science corpus spanning over eight decades and including original articles in Dutch, German and French, on top of a large majority of articles in English. To circumvent this multilingual problem, we use machine-translation tools to bulk translate non-English documents into English. Though largely imperfect, especially syntactically, these translations nevertheless provide correctly translated terms and preserve the semantic proximity of documents with respect to one another. To assess the quality of this translation step, we develop a ``semantic topology preservation test'' that relies on estimating the extent to which document-to-document distances have been preserved during translation. We then conduct an LDA topic-model analysis over the entire corpus of translated and English original texts, and compare it to a topic-model done over the English original texts only. We thereby identify the specific contribution of the translated texts. These studies reveal a more complete picture of main topics that can found in the philosophy of science literature, especially during the early days of the discipline when numerous articles were published in languages other than English.},

By running text-mining and topic-modeling algorithms, we identified 67 key research topics that span across these 32 years. We also investigated the evolution of these topics over time and their fluctuating significance in the journal articles. Our results concur with known episodes or traits of the discipline---for instance, the significance of evolution-related topics or the decrease of articles with a marked historical dimension---but also highlight a diversity of topics that is much richer than what is usually acknowledged.},

The method uses an additional input parameter {\textasciicircum} and acts like a hybrid between DBSCAN* and HDBSCAN. It can easily be integrated into existing HDBSCAN implementations.},

We examined seven numerical characteristics of reference lists of 50,878 research articles published in 17 ecological journals between 1997 and 2017. Over this period, significant changes occurred in reference lists' features. On average, more recent papers have longer reference lists and cite more high Impact Factor papers and fewer non-journal publications. We also show that highly cited articles across the ecological literature have longer reference lists, cite more recent and impactful references, and include more self-citations. Conversely, the proportion of `classic' papers and non-journal publications cited, as well as the temporal span of the reference list, have no significant influence on articles' citations. From this analysis, we distill a recipe for crafting impactful reference lists, at least in ecology.},

As such, it represents a paramount example of collective coordination action on social media, resulting in large-scale consensus formation and significant market impact. In this work we characterise the structure and time evolution of Reddit conversation data, showing that the occurrence and sentiment of GME-related comments (representing how much users are engaged with GME) increased significantly much before the short squeeze actually took place. Taking inspiration from these early warnings as well as evidence from previous literature, we introduce a model of opinion dynamics where user engagement can trigger a self-reinforcing mechanism leading to the emergence of consensus, which in this particular case is associated to the success of the short squeeze operation. Analytical solutions and model simulations on interaction networks of Reddit users feature a phase transition from heterogeneous to homogeneous opinions as engagement grows, which we qualitatively compare to the sudden hike of GME stock price. Although the model cannot be validated with available data, it offers a possible and minimal interpretation for the increasingly important phenomenon of self-organized collective actions taking place on social networks.},

While there have been many attempts at embedding words and graphs, formula embedding is in its early stages. We introduce a new formula embedding model that we use with two hierarchical representations, (1) Symbol Layout Trees (SLTs) for appearance, and (2) Operator Trees (OPTs) for mathematical content. Following the approach of graph embeddings such as DeepWalk, we generate tuples representing paths between pairs of symbols depth-first, embed tuples using the fastText n-gram embedding model, and then represent an SLT or OPT by its average tuple embedding vector. We then combine SLT and OPT embeddings, leading to state-of-the-art results for the NTCIR-12 formula retrieval task. Our fine-grained holistic vector representations allow us to retrieve many more partially similar formulas than methods using structural matching in trees. Combining our embedding model with structural matching in the Approach0 formula search engine produces state-of-the-art results for both fully and partially relevant results on the NTCIR-12 benchmark. Source code for our system is publicly available.},

We confined our attention to the generation of texts which are syntactically well-formed, meet certain pre-specified patterns of metre and broadly convey some given meaning. Such aspects can be formally defined, thus avoiding the complications of imagery and interpretation that are central to assessing more free forms of verse. Our implemented system, McGONAGALL, applies the genetic algorithm to construct such texts. It uses a sophisticated linguistic formalism to represent its genomic information, from which can be computed the phenotypic information of both semantic representations and patterns of stress. The conducted experiments broadly indicated that relatively meaningful text could be produced if the constraints on metre were relaxed, and precise metric text was possible with loose semantic constraints, but it was difficult to produce text which was both semantically coherent and of high quality metrically.},

  abstract = {Exploring multidimensional datasets is a ubiquitous part of the ones working with data, where interpreting clusters is one of the main tasks. These multidimensional datasets are usually encoded using scatter-plots representations, where spatial proximity encodes similarity among data samples. In the literature, techniques try to understand the scatter plot organization by visualizing the importance of the features for clusters definition with interaction and layout enrichment strategies. However, the approaches used to interpret dimensionality reduction usually do not differentiate clusters well, which hampers analysis where the focus is to understand the differences among clusters. This paper introduces a methodology to visually explore multidimensional datasets and interpret clusters' formation based on the contrastive analysis. We also introduce a bipartite graph to visually interpret and explore the relationship between the statistical variables used to understand how the attributes influenced cluster formation. Our methodology is validated through case studies. We explore a multivariate dataset of patients with vertebral problems and two document collections, one related to news articles and other related to tweets about COVID-19 symptoms. Finally, we also validate our approach through quantitative results to demonstrate how it can be robust enough to support multidimensional analysis.},

The new promotion system pursuant Gelmini Law (210/2010) in Italy implies to go through two steps. First, they have to obtain the national ASN system (fit-for-the-role national filter), based on merit measured via bibliometric and non-bibliometric indicators. This step does not mean to get a position, it only means to be able to apply for it at institutional level. We believe that discrimination based on gender may happen especially at institutional level as in comparison to ASN there is less transparency and more autonomy at institutional level. It is also hypothesised that discrimination based on gender may differ according to the percentage of women already at full professor rank by disciplinary field. We investigate gender inequality using a binary variable (promoted or not promoted along 2013 until 2016) controlling by scientific productivity, normalised number of available vacancies, result of national research evaluation (VQR---department of candidate's affiliation), age, current rank-and-file position. Multilevel logistic regression demonstrates that among those who obtained the ASN and at parity of other conditions, men have around 24\% more probability to be promoted at parity of scientific production, which reveals a relevant gender discrimination. Our findings have implications on theory about inequality regimes and might serve to reflect on how to improve practices at institutional level.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the universe has grown rapidly in recent decades. We've discovered evidence of water in nearby planets, discovered planets outside our solar system, mapped the genomes of thousands of organisms, and probed the very origins and limits of life. The scientific perspective of life-as-it-could-be has expanded in part by research in astrobiology, synthetic biology, and artificial life. In the face of such scientific developments, we argue there is an ever-growing need for universal biology, life-as-it-mustbe, the multidisciplinary study of non-contingent aspects of life as guided by biological theory and constrained by the universe. We present three distinct but connected ways of universalizing biology---with respect to characterizing aspects of life everywhere, with respect to the explanatory scope of biological theory, and with respect to extending biological insights to the structure of nonbiological entities. For each of these, we sketch the theoretical goals and challenges, as well as give examples of current research that might be labeled universal biology.},

  abstract = {There is considerable correspondence between theories and models used in biology and the social sciences. One type of model that is in use in both biology and the social sciences is the fitness landscape model. The properties of the fitness landscape model have been applied rather freely in the social domain. This is partly due to the versatility of the model, but it is also due to the difficulties of transferring a model to another domain. We will demonstrate that in order to transfer the biological fitness landscape model to the social science it needs to be substantially modified. We argue that the syntactic structure of the model can remain unaltered, whilst the semantic dimension requires considerable modification in order to fit the specific phenomena in the social sciences. We will first discuss the origin as well as the basic properties of the model. Subsequently, we will demonstrate the considerations and modifications pertaining to such a transfer by showing how and why we altered the model to analyse collective decision-making processes. We will demonstrate that the properties of the target domain allow for a transfer of the syntactic structure but don't tolerate the semantic transfer.},

After Scopus, Dimensions is fourth largest (54\% of all citations), including 84\% of Scopus citations and 88\% of WoS citations. It found more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and displays some coverage gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI is the smallest, with 28\% of all citations. Conclusions Google Scholar is still the most comprehensive source. In many subject categories Microsoft Academic and Dimensions are good alternatives to Scopus and WoS in terms of coverage.},

In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2,299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93\%-96\%), far ahead of Scopus (35\%-77\%) and WoS (27\%-73\%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95\%) and Scopus (92\%) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48\%-65\%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19\%-38\%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between GS and WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas GS citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial extra coverage.},

The relationship between human rationality and Bayesian methods will be explored, and we will see that Bayesian ideas can indeed be used to explain how humans reason. We will see how to use Bayesian-inspired rules using the simplest version of the Continuous Opinions and Discrete Actions (CODA) model. From that, we will explore how we can obtain update rules that include human behavioral characteristics such as confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, or our tendency to change opinions much less than we should.},

  abstract = {In response to failures of central planning, the Chinese government has experimented not only with free-market trade zones, but with allowing non-profit foundations to operate in a decentralized fashion. A network study shows how these foundations have connected together by sharing board members, in a structural parallel to what is seen in corporations in the United States and Europe. This board interlocking leads to the emergence of an elite group with privileged network positions. While the presence of government officials on non-profit boards is widespread, government officials are much less common in a subgroup of foundations that control just over half of all revenue in the network. This subgroup, associated with business elites, not only enjoys higher levels of within-elite links, but even preferentially excludes government officials from the NGOs with higher degree. The emergence of this structurally autonomous sphere is associated with major political and social events in the state--society relationship. Cluster analysis reveals multiple internal components within this sphere that share similar levels of network influence. Rather than a core-periphery structure centered around government officials, the Chinese non-profit world appears to be a multipolar one of distinct elite groups, many of which achieve high levels of independence from direct government control.},

  abstract = {Referring constitutes such an essential scholarly activity across disciplines that it has been regarded by Unsworth (2000) as one of the scholarly primitives. In Classics, in particular, the references to passages of the ancient texts---the so-called canonical citations (or references)---play a prominent role. The potential of these citations, however, has not been fully exploited to date, despite the attention that they have recently received in the field of Digital Humanities. In this paper I discuss two aspects of making such citations computable. Firstly, I illustrate how they can be extracted from text by using Natural Language Processing techniques, especially Named Entity Recognition. Secondly, I discuss the creation of a three-level citation network to formalise the web of relations between texts that canonical references implicitly constitute. As I outline in the conclusive section of this paper, the possible uses of the extracted citation network include the development of search applications and recommender systems for bibliography; the enhancement of digital environments to read primary sources with links to related secondary literature and the application of these network to the study of intertextuality and text reception.},

This paper analytically investigates the model. Taking advantage of the knowledge about the agents' preferences, a notion of available neighbourhood compositions (those fulfilling an agent's preferences) is developed. The unweighted average segregation of those available neighbourhoods allows a reasonable approximation of the simulation results, which overrates the actual final rate of segregation instead of underrating it as done intuitively. Additionally, the concept of neighbourhood compositions possibly serves as explanations for the behaviour of the simulation.},

  abstract = {What explains the origins and survival of the first states around five thousand years ago? In this research, we focus on the role of weather-related productivity shocks for early state development in ancient Egypt. We present a framework of extractive state consolidation predicting that political stability should be high whenever environmental circumscription is high, i.e., whenever there is a large gap between the productivity of the area under state control (core) and that of the surrounding areas (hinterland). In such periods, the elite can impose high levels of taxation that the population will be forced to accept as exit to the hinterland is not an attractive option. In order to test this hypothesis, we develop novel proxies for both the historical productivity of the Nile banks and of the Egyptian hinterland on the basis of high-resolution paleoclimate archives. Our empirical analysis then investigates the relationship between these proxies for environmental circumscription and political outcomes such as ruler and dynastic tenure durations and the intensity of pyramid construction during 2685 - 750 BCE. Our results show that while extreme Nile floods are associated with a greater degree of political instability, periods with a greater rainfall in the hinterland (i.e. a lower effective environmental circumscription) are associated with an immediate rise in military and pyramid construction activity but also with a delayed increase in political instability.},

Our empirical investigation, utilizing multiple data sets spanning several millennia, demonstrates a causal e¤ect of the cultivation of cereals on hierarchy, without {\dots}nding a similar e¤ect for land productivity. We further support our claims with several case studies.},

This paper maps out some of the key topographical features of this metaphysical, social imaginary --scape, and situates the physical body of the global yoga practitioner within a complex entanglement of intersecting social, political, economic and theological `worlds'. This paper first explores how the concept of spiritual bypass effects a particular averted gaze towards problematic issues within Yogaland. This leads to the second part of the paper that discusses the fundamental nature of entanglement, which often involves being entangled in worlds the individual would not want, mean to be, or perhaps even be aware, exist. Therefore, this paper identifies ways in which global yoga participants are socialised through their neo-liberal subjectivities to unwittingly support, in an often banal way, a Hindu supremacist ideology; which, in turn, can lead to a type of `yoga fundamentalism'.},

Deep clustering algorithms usually combine representation learning with deep neural networks to achieve this performance, typically optimizing a clustering and non-clustering loss. In such cases, an autoencoder is typically connected with a clustering network, and the final clustering is jointly learned by both the autoencoder and clustering network. Instead, we propose to learn an autoencoded embedding and then search this further for the underlying manifold. For simplicity, we then cluster this with a shallow clustering algorithm, rather than a deeper network. We study a number of local and global manifold learning methods on both the raw data and autoencoded embedding, concluding that UMAP in our framework is able to find the best clusterable manifold of the embedding. This suggests that local manifold learning on an autoencoded embedding is effective for discovering higher quality clusters. We quantitatively show across a range of image and timeseries datasets that our method has competitive performance against the latest deep clustering algorithms, including out-performing current state-of-the-art on several. We postulate that these results show a promising research direction for deep clustering. The code can be found at https://github.com/rymc/n2d.},

"A central feature of Kim's argument is that higher-level properties can in general be identified with "micro-based" properties. I argue that explanations from multi-scale analysis give examples of explanations that are problematic for accounts such as Kim's. I argue that these difficulties suggest that some standard assumptions about causal competition need to be revised.},

However, while the method is often used to inform about historical demographic processes, little is known about the relationship between fundamental demographic parameters and the projection of samples onto the primary axes. Here I show that for SNP data the projection of samples onto the principal components can be obtained directly from considering the average coalescent times between pairs of haploid genomes. The result provides a framework for interpreting PCA projections in terms of underlying processes, including migration, geographical isolation, and admixture. I also demonstrate a link between PCA and Wright's fst and show that SNP ascertainment has a largely simple and predictable effect on the projection of samples. Using examples from human genetics, I discuss the application of these results to empirical data and the implications for inference.},

While empirical reality answers with an astounding yes, the mathematical analysis, based on linear stability theory, seems to suggest the contrary - hence, the diversity-stability paradox. Here we present a solution to this dichotomy, by considering the interplay between topology and dynamics. We show that this interplay leads to the emergence of non-random patterns in the system's stability matrix, leading us to relinquish the prevailing random matrix-based paradigm. Instead, we offer a new matrix ensemble, which captures the dynamic stability of real-world systems. This ensemble helps us analytically identify the relevant control parameters that predict a system's stability, exposing three broad dynamic classes: In the asymptotically unstable class, diversity, indeed, leads to instability May's paradox. However, we also expose an asymptotically stable class, the class in which most real systems reside, in which diversity not only does not prohibit, but, in fact, enhances dynamic stability. Finally, in the sensitively stable class diversity plays no role, and hence stability is driven by the system's microscopic parameters. Together, our theory uncovers the naturally emerging rules of complex system stability, helping us reconcile the paradox that has eluded us for decades.},

The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering C to clustering C{$\prime$}. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only ``sensible'' criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded.},

  abstract = {Dehumanization is a pernicious psychological process that often leads to extreme intergroup bias, hate speech, and violence aimed at targeted social groups. Despite these serious consequences and the wealth of available data, dehumanization has not yet been computationally studied on a large scale. Drawing upon social psychology research, we create a computational linguistic framework for analyzing dehumanizing language by identifying linguistic correlates of salient components of dehumanization. We then apply this framework to analyze discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times from 1986 to 2015. Overall, we find increasingly humanizing descriptions of LGBTQ people over time. However, we find that the label homosexual has emerged to be much more strongly associated with dehumanizing attitudes than other labels, such as gay. Our proposed techniques highlight processes of linguistic variation and change in discourses surrounding marginalized groups. Furthermore, the ability to analyze dehumanizing language at a large scale has implications for automatically detecting and understanding media bias as well as abusive language online.},

  abstract = {Human mobility is known to be distributed across several orders of magnitude of physical distances, which makes it generally difficult to endogenously find or define typical and meaningful scales. Relevant analyses, from movements to geographical partitions, seem to be relative to some ad-hoc scale, or no scale at all. Relying on geotagged data collected from photo-sharing social media, we apply community detection to movement networks constrained by increasing percentiles of the distance distribution. Using a simple parameter-free discontinuity detection algorithm, we discover clear phase transitions in the community partition space. The detection of these phases constitutes the first objective method of characterising endogenous, natural scales of human movement. Our study covers nine regions, ranging from cities to countries of various sizes and a transnational area. For all regions, the number of natural scales is remarkably low (2 or 3). Further, our results hint at scale-related behaviours rather than scale-related users. The partitions of the natural scales allow us to draw discrete multi-scale geographical boundaries, potentially capable of providing key insights in fields such as epidemiology or cultural contagion where the introduction of spatial boundaries is pivotal.},

  abstract = {Scientific mapping has now become an important subject in the scientometrics field. Journal clustering can provide insights into both the internal relations among journals and the evolution trend of studies. In this paper, we apply the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm to do scientific journal clustering. The AP algorithm identifies clusters by detecting their representative points through message passing within the data points. Compared with other clustering algorithms, it can provide representatives for each cluster and does not need to pre-specify the number of clusters. Because the input of the AP algorithm is the similarity matrix among data points, it can be applied to various forms of data sets with different similarity metrics. In this paper, we extract the similarity matrices from the journal data sets in both cross citation view and text view and use the AP algorithm to cluster the journals. Through empirical analysis, we conclude that these two clustering results by the two single views are highly complementary. Therefore, we further combine text information with cross citation information by using the simple average scheme and apply the AP algorithm to conduct multi-view clustering. The multi-view clustering strategy aims at obtaining refined clusters by integrating information from multiple views. With text view and citation view integrated, experiments on the Web of Science journal data set verify that the AP algorithm obtains better clustering results as expected.},

The latest methods are scalable to thousands of cells, enabling in-depth characterization of sample composition without prior knowledge. However, there are important differences between scRNA-seq techniques, and it remains unclear which are the most suitable protocols for drawing cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. We have generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate techniques in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multi-center study comparing 13 commonly used single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols using a highly heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative and integrative analysis at cell type and state level revealed marked differences in protocol performance, highlighting a series of key features for cell atlas projects. These should be considered when defining guidelines and standards for international consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas project.},

Previous research shows that group members' social sensitivity is a potential antecedent of collective intelligence, yet it is still unclear whether individual or group-level indices are responsible for the positive association between social sensitivity and collective intelligence. In a comprehensive manner, we test the extent to which both compositional (lowest and highest individual score) and compilational aspects (emergent group level) of social sensitivity are associated with collective intelligence. This study has implications for research that explores groups as information processors, and has implications for group design as it indicates how a group should be composed with respect to social sensitivity if the group is to reach high levels of collective intelligence. Our empirical results indicate that collectively intelligent groups are those in which the least socially sensitive group member has a rather high score on social sensitivity. Differently stated, (socially sensitive) group members cannot compensate for the lack of social sensitivity of the other group members.},

We present a method to find the maximum likelihood assignment of bot labels by solving a minimum cut problem. Our algorithm allows for the simultaneous detection of multiple bots that are potentially engaging in a coordinated influence campaign, in contrast to other methods that identify bots one at a time. We find that our algorithm is able to more accurately find bots than existing methods when compared to a human labeled ground truth. We also look at the content posted by the bots we identify and find that they seem to have a coordinated agenda.},

The paper argues that in these texts the notion of data is not used merely as a rhetorical category, and also cannot strictly be identified with the category of evidence. Instead, the notion comes with an associated epistemic structure, one that is in line with its development from an early mathematical use.},

  abstract = {Charles Peirce's classification of the sciences was designed shortly after the turn of the twentieth century. The classification has two main sources of inspiration: Comte's science classification and Kant's theoretical philosophy. Peirce's classification, like that of Comte, is hierarchically organised in that the more general and abstract sciences provide principles for the less general and more concrete sciences. However, Peirce includes and assigns a superordinate role to philosophical disciplines which analyse and provide logical, methodological and ontological principles for the specialised sciences, and which are based on everyday life experience. Moreover, Peirce recognises two main branches of specialised empirical science: the natural sciences, on the one hand, and the social sciences, the humanities and psychology on the other. While both branches share logical and methodological principles, they are based on different ontological principles in studying physical nature and the human mind and its products, respectively. Peirce's most basic philosophical discipline, phenomenology, transforms his early engagement with Kant. Peirce's classification of aesthetics, ethics and logic as normative sub-disciplines of philosophy relate to his philosophical pragmatism. Yet his more overarching division between theoretical (philosophical and specialised) sciences and practical sciences may be seen as problematic. Taking Peirce's historical account of scientific developments into consideration, however, I argue that his science classification and its emphasis on the interdependencies between the sciences could be seen as sustaining and supporting interdisciplinarity and interaction across fields of research, even across the divide between theoretical and practical sciences.},

Agent-based models (ABM) allow for dynamic transmission modeling but publications are limited. We aim to provide an overview of important characteristics of ABM for decision-analytic modeling of infectious diseases. A case study of dengue epidemics illustrates model characteristics, conceptualization, calibration and model analysis. First, major characteristics of ABM are outlined and discussed based on ISPOR and ISPOR-SMDM Good Practice guidelines. Second, in our case study, we modeled a dengue outbreak in Cebu City (Philippines) to assess the impact interventions to control the relative growth of the mosquito population. Model outcomes include prevalence and incidence of infected persons. The modular ABM simulates persons and mosquitoes over an annual time horizon considering daily time steps. The model was calibrated and validated. ABM is a dynamic, individual-level modeling approach that is capable to reproduce direct and indirect effects of interventions for infectious diseases. The ability to replicate emerging behavior and to include human behavior or the behavior of other agents is a distinguishing modeling characteristic (e.g., compared to Markov models). Modeling behavior may, however, require extensive calibration and validation. The analyzed hypothetical effectiveness of dengue interventions showed that a reduced human-mosquito ratio of 1:2.5 during rainy seasons leads already to a substantial decrease of infected persons. ABM can support decision-analyses for infectious diseases including disease dynamics, emerging behavior, and providing a high level of reusability due to modularity.},

  abstract = {While the modern science is characterized by an exponential growth in scientific literature, the increase in publication volume clearly does not reflect the expansion of the cognitive boundaries of science. Nevertheless, most of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science or for making funding and policy decisions are based on productivity. Similarly, the increasing level of knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy greater visibility, does not necessarily mean that ``big science'' leads to cognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles published over 60--130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve {$<$}1\% precision. We show that the periods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in publication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries of science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of the cognitive territory can also be applied to study many other aspects of `science of science.' {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Web of Science provides classification of journals into {\textasciitilde}250 subject categories, which has served as a basis for many studies, is known to have some fundamental problems and several practical limitations that may affect the results from such studies. Here we present an easily reproducible method to perform reclassification of the Web of Science into existing subject categories and into 14 broad areas. Our reclassification is at a level of articles, so it preserves disciplinary differences that may exist among individual articles published in the same journal. Reclassification also eliminates ambiguous (multiple) categories that are found for 50\% of items, and assigns a discipline/field category to all articles that come from broad-coverage journals such as Nature and Science. The correctness of the assigned subject categories is evaluated manually and is found to be {\textasciitilde}95\%.},

As language models are increasingly applied to medicine, there is a growing interest in building algorithmic fairness into processes impacting patient care. Much of the work addressing this question has focused on biases encoded in language models---statistical estimates of the relationships between concepts derived from distant reading of corpora. Building on this work, we investigate how word choices made by healthcare practitioners and language models interact with regards to bias. We identify and remove gendered language from two clinical-note datasets and describe a new debiasing procedure using BERT-based gender classifiers. We show minimal degradation in health condition classification tasks for low- to medium-levels of bias removal via data augmentation. Finally, we compare the bias semantically encoded in the language models with the bias empirically observed in health records. This work outlines an interpretable approach for using data augmentation to identify and reduce the potential for bias in natural language processing pipelines.},

  abstract = {From early in development, humans show a strong preference for members of their own groups, even in so-called minimal (i.e., arbitrary and unfamiliar) groups, leading to tremendous negative consequences such as outgroup discrimination and derogation. A better understanding of the underlying processes driving humans' group mindedness is an important first step toward fighting discrimination and inequality on a bigger level. Based on the assumption that minimal group allocation elicits the anticipation of future within-group cooperation, which in turn elicits ingroup preference, we investigate whether changing participants' anticipation from within-group cooperation to between-group cooperation reduces their ingroup bias. In the present set of five studies (overall N = 465) we test this claim in two different populations (children and adults), in two different countries (United States and Germany), and in two kinds of groups (minimal and social group based on gender). Results confirm that changing participants' anticipation of who they will cooperate with from ingroup to outgroup members significantly reduces their ingroup bias in minimal groups, though not for gender, a noncoalitional group. In summary, these experiments provide robust evidence for the hypothesis that children and adults encode minimal group membership as a marker for future collaboration. They show that experimentally manipulating this expectation can eliminate their minimal ingroup bias. This study sheds light on the underlying cognitive processes in intergroup behavior throughout development and opens up new avenues for research on reducing ingroup bias and discrimination.},

On the epistemological and ethical basis of trust in medical AI'1 that traditionally proposed solutions to make black box machine learning models in medicine less opaque and more transparent are, though necessary, ultimately not sufficient to establish their overall trustworthiness. This is because transparency procedures currently employed, such as the use of an interpretable predictor (IP),2 cannot fully overcome the opacity of such models. Computational reliabilism (CR), an alternate approach to adjudicating trustworthiness that goes beyond transparency solutions, is argued to be a more promising approach. CR can bring the benefits of traditional process reliabilism in epistemology to bear on this problem of model trustworthiness. Dur{\'a}n et al 's explicitly reliabilist epistemology to assess the trustworthiness of black box models is a timely addition to current transparency-focused approaches in the literature. Their delineation of the epistemic from the ethical also serves the debate by clarifying the nature of the different problems. However, their overall account underestimates the epistemic value of certain transparency-enabling approaches by conflating different types of opacity and also oversimplifies transparency-advocating arguments in the literature. First, it is unclear why Dur{\'a}n et al consider transparency approaches as insufficient to overcome epistemic opacity, if heiraccount of opacity is the traditional one from the machine learning literature: opacity stemming from the mismatch between (1) mathematical optimisation in high dimensionality that is characteristic of machine learning and (2) the demands of human-scale reasoning and styles of semantic interpretation.3 {\dots}},

This poses a problem for cultural evolution: if beginners cannot simply imitate experts, and experts cannot simply say or demonstrate what they are doing, how can tacit knowledge pass from generation to generation? We present a domain-general model of "tacit teaching", that shows how high-fidelity transmission of tacit knowledge is possible. It applies in cases where the underlying features of the practice are subject to interacting and competing constraints, as is expected both in embodied and in social practices. Our model makes predictions for key features of the teaching process. It predicts a tell-tale distribution of teaching outcomes: some students will be nearly perfect performers while others receiving the same instruction will be disastrously bad. This differs from most mainstream cultural evolution models centered on high-fidelity transmission with minimal copying errors, which lead to a much narrower distribution where students are mostly equally mediocre. The model also predicts generic features of the cultural evolution of tacit knowledge. The evolution of tacit knowledge is expected to be bursty, with long periods of stability interspersed with brief periods of dramatic change, and where tacit knowledge, once lost, becomes essentially impossible to recover.},

The data also show upward trends in appeals to case studies in articles published in Philosophy of Science, the BJPS, and the JGPS.

In this paper, I aim to make a contribution to this debate by taking an empirical approach. I present the results of a systematic survey of the PhilSci-Archive, which suggest that a sizeable proportion of papers in philosophy of science contain appeals to case studies, as indicated by the occurrence of the indicator words ``case study'' and/or ``case studies.'' These results are confirmed by data mined from the JSTOR database on research articles published in leading journals in the field: Philosophy of Science, the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science ( BJPS), and the Journal for General Philosophy of Science ( JGPS), as well as the Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association ( PSA). The data also show upward trends in appeals to case studies in articles published in Philosophy of Science, the BJPS, and the JGPS. The empirical work I have done for this paper provides philosophers of science who are wary of the use of case studies as evidence for and/or against theories about science with a way to do philosophy of science that is informed by data rather than case studies.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted among philosophers of science that hypothesis testing (or confirmation) is a key methodological feature of science. As far as philosophical theories of confirmation are concerned, some emphasize the role of deduction in confirmation (e.g. the H-D method), whereas others emphasize the role of induction in confirmation (e.g. Bayesian theories of confirmation). The aim of this paper is to contribute to our understanding of scientific confirmation (or hypothesis testing) in scientific practice by taking an empirical approach. I propose that it would be illuminating to learn how practicing scientists describe their methods when they test hypotheses and/or theories. I use the tools of data science and corpus linguistics to study patterns of usage in a large corpus of scientific publications mined from the JSTOR database. Overall, the results of this empirical survey suggest that there is an emphasis on mostly the inductive aspects of confirmation in the life sciences and the social sciences, but not in the physical and the formal sciences. The results also point to interesting and significant differences between the scientific subjects within these disciplinary groups that are worth investigating in future studies.},

If philosophy of science relies heavily on induction, just as science supposedly does, then we would expect to find significantly more inductive arguments than deductive arguments and abductive arguments in the published works of philosophers of science. Using indicator words to classify arguments by type (namely, deductive, inductive, and abductive arguments), we search through our corpus to find patterns of argumentation. Overall, the results of our study suggest that philosophers of science do rely on inductive inference. But induction may not be as foundational to philosophy of science as it is thought to be for science, given that philosophers of science make significantly more deductive arguments than inductive arguments. Interestingly, our results also suggest that philosophers of science do not rely on abductive arguments all that much, even though philosophers of science consider abduction to be a cornerstone of scientific methodology.},

The results of this empirical study suggest that mathematical explanations do occur in research articles published in mathematics journals, as indicated by the occurrence of explanation indicators. When compared with the use of justification indicators, however, the data suggest that justifications occur much more frequently than explanations in scholarly mathematical practice. The results also suggest that justificatory proofs occur much more frequently than explanatory proofs, thus suggesting that proof may be playing a larger justificatory role than an explanatory role in scholarly mathematical practice.},

The chapter provides a review of the modeling work, which has aimed at understanding the functioning of epistemic communities. Modeling done by social epistemologists resides at an interesting junction of various strands of inquiry. The chapter provides an overview of some of the most prominent modeling approaches in social epistemology and describes a general approach to interpreting models, thereby suggesting how they could be integrated with conceptual and empirical work done in the rest of the field.},

In particular, in spite of explicitly stated equity norms, categorical inequity tends to be the rule rather than the exception. The cultural Red King hypothesis predicts that differentials in group size may lead to inequitable outcomes for minority groups even in the absence of explicit or implicit bias. We test this prediction in an experimental context where subjects divided into groups engage in repeated play of a bargaining game. We ran 14 trials involving a total of 112 participants. The results of the experiments are statistically significant and suggestive: individuals in minority groups in these experiments end up receiving fewer resources than those in majority groups. Combined with previous theoretical findings, these results give some reason to think that the cultural Red King may occur in real human groups.},

We use GPT-4 and ChatGPT to augment small labeled datasets with synthetic data via simple prompts, in three different classification tasks with varying complexity. For each task, we randomly select a base sample of 500 texts to generate 5,000 new synthetic samples. We explore two augmentation strategies: one that preserves original label distribution and another that balances the distribution. Using a progressively larger training sample size, we train and evaluate a 110M parameter multilingual language model on the real and synthetic data separately. We also test GPT-4 and ChatGPT in a zero-shot setting on the test sets. We observe that GPT-4 and ChatGPT have strong zero-shot performance across all tasks. We find that data augmented with synthetic samples yields a good downstream performance, and particularly aids in low-resource settings, such as in identifying rare classes. Human-annotated data exhibits a strong predictive power, overtaking synthetic data in two out of the three tasks. This finding highlights the need for more complex prompts for synthetic datasets to consistently surpass human-generated ones.},

These fundamental papers initiated a new era of research establishing an interdisciplinary field called network science. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the field, a diverse but not divided network science community has emerged in the past 20 years. This paper honors the contributions of network science by exploring the evolution of this community as seen through the growing co-authorship network of network scientists (here the notion refers to a scholar with at least one paper citing at least one of the three aforementioned milestone papers). After investigating various characteristics of 29,528 network science papers, we construct the co-authorship network of 52,406 network scientists and we analyze its topology and dynamics. We shed light on the collaboration patterns of the last 20 years of network science by investigating numerous structural properties of the co-authorship network and by using enhanced data visualization techniques. We also identify the most central authors, the largest communities, investigate the spatiotemporal changes, and compare the properties of the network to scientometric indicators.},

  abstract = {Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are used in several fields to study the evolution of complex systems from micro-level assumptions. However, ABMs typically can not estimate agent-specific (or "micro") variables: this is a major limitation which prevents ABMs from harnessing micro-level data availability and which greatly limits their predictive power. In this paper, we propose a protocol to learn the latent micro-variables of an ABM from data. The first step of our protocol is to reduce an ABM to a probabilistic model, characterized by a computationally tractable likelihood. This reduction follows two general design principles: balance of stochasticity and data availability, and replacement of unobservable discrete choices with differentiable approximations. Then, our protocol proceeds by maximizing the likelihood of the latent variables via a gradient-based expectation maximization algorithm. We demonstrate our protocol by applying it to an ABM of the housing market, in which agents with different incomes bid higher prices to live in high-income neighborhoods. We demonstrate that the obtained model allows accurate estimates of the latent variables, while preserving the general behavior of the ABM. We also show that our estimates can be used for out-of-sample forecasting. Our protocol can be seen as an alternative to black-box data assimilation methods, that forces the modeler to lay bare the assumptions of the model, to think about the inferential process, and to spot potential identification problems.},

Next, we use a gradient-based expectation maximization algorithm to maximize the likelihood of the latent variables. We showcase the efficacy of our protocol on an ABM of the housing market, where agents with different incomes bid higher prices to live in high-income neighborhoods. Our protocol produces accurate estimates of the latent variables while preserving the general behavior of the ABM. Moreover, our estimates substantially improve the out-of-sample forecasting capabilities of the ABM compared to simpler heuristics. Our protocol encourages modelers to articulate assumptions, consider the inferential process, and spot potential identification problems, thus making it a useful alternative to black-box data assimilation methods.},

  abstract = {To find out, we measure co-voting similarity networks in the US Senate and trace individual careers over time. Standard network visualization tools fail on dense highly clustered networks, so we used two aggregation strategies to clarify positional mobility over time. First, clusters of Senators who often vote the same way capture               coalitions               , and allow us to measure polarization quantitatively through modularity (Newman, 2006; Waugh et al., 2009; Poole, 2012). Second, we use role-based blockmodels (White et al., 1976) to identify role positions, identifying sets of Senators with highly similar tie patterns. Our partitioning threshold for roles is stringent, generating many roles occupied by single Senators. This combination allows us to identify movement between positions over time (specifically, we used the Kernighan--Lin improvement of a Louvain method greedy partitioning algorithm for modularity [Blondel et al., 2008], and CONCOR with an internal similarity threshold for roles; see Supplementary materials for details).},

  abstract = {In recent years, dimensionality reduction methods have become critical for visualization, exploration, and interpretation of high-throughput, high-dimensional biological data, as they enable the extraction of major trends in the data while discarding noise. However, biological data contains a type of predominant structure that is not preserved in commonly used methods such as PCA and tSNE, namely, branching progression structure. This structure, which is often non-linear, arises from underlying biological processes such as differentiation, graded responses to stimuli, and population drift, which generate cellular (or population) diversity. We propose a novel, affinity-preserving embedding called PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding), designed explicitly to preserve progression structure in data. PHATE provides a denoised, two or three-dimensional visualization of the complete branching trajectory structure in high-dimensional data. It uses heat-diffusion processes, which naturally denoise the data, to compute cell-cell affinities. Then, PHATE creates a diffusion-potential geometry by free-energy potentials of these processes. This geometry captures high-dimensional trajectory structures, while enabling a natural embedding of the intrinsic data geometry. This embedding accurately visualizes trajectories and data distances, without requiring strict assumptions typically used by path-finding and tree-fitting algorithms, which have recently been used for pseudotime orderings or tree-renderings of cellular data. Furthermore, PHATE supports a wide range of data exploration tasks by providing interpretable overlays on top of the visualization. We show that such overlays can emphasize and reveal trajectory end-points, branch points and associated split-decisions, progression-forming variables (e.g., specific genes), and paths between developmental events in cellular state-space. We demonstrate PHATE on single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry data pertaining to embryoid body differentiation, IPSC reprogramming, and hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. We also demonstrate PHATE on non-single cell data including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) measurements of European populations, and 16s sequencing of gut microbiota.},

  abstract = {Tenure-track faculty play a special role in society: they train future researchers, and they produce much of the scholarship that drives scientific, technological, and social innovation. However, the professoriate has never been demographically representative of the general population it serves. For example in the United States, Black and Hispanic scholars are underrepresented across the tenure-track, and while women's representation has increased over time, they remain a minority in many academic fields. Here we investigate the representativeness of faculty childhood socioeconomic status and whether it may implicitly limit efforts to diversify the professoriate in terms of race, gender, and geography. Using a survey of 7218 professors in PhD-granting departments in the United States across eight disciplines in STEM, social sciences, and the humanities, we find that the estimated median childhood household income among faculty is 23.7\% higher than the general public, and faculty are 25 times more likely to have a parent with a PhD. Moreover, the proportion of faculty with PhD parents nearly doubles at more prestigious universities and is stable across the past 50 years. Our results suggest that the professoriate is, and has remained, accessible mainly to the socioeconomically privileged. This lack of socioeconomic diversity is likely to deeply shape the type of scholarship and scholars that faculty produce and train.},

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences. This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, tthe American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

A desirable property of this index is that it can be decomposed into the contributions pertaining to each stage of the hierarchies. We show the relations of such components with the currently used criteria for comparing two partitions. We obtain a global similarity index as the complement to one of the suggested dissimilarity and we derive its adjustment for agreement due to chance. We obtain similarity indexes pertaining to each stage of the hierarchies as the complement to one of the additive parts of the global distance Z . We consider the use of the proposed distance for more than two dendrograms and its use for the consensus of classifications and variable selection in cluster analysis.

Imposing cognitive limitations on human logical reasoning ability (bounded rationality) is a well-known case in point. Extending cognition to parts of body outside the brain, and to environment outside the body is another. In contrast, the present article takes a constructive approach, also in an exploratory spirit. For the sake of exposition, we consider three tiered realms of scientific inquiry: physical or inanimate, biological or animate, and socio-psychological or sentient. In this three-tier framework, we explore the extent of gains in modeling human action within the confines of physical principles such as optimization. In this exercise, concepts of complexity and emergence account for the absence of analytically derivable mapping from micro or finer grain phenomena to macro or coarser grain phenomena. A general notion of embodiment captures the inclusion of a more expansive range of explanatory factors in modeling and understanding a given phenomenon. Emergence and embodiment play complementary roles in exploration of human behavior.},

  abstract = {The traditional Great Man theory of leadership is treated with scant respect, yet it is still widely in use. This article reconstructs and reevaluates Tolstoy's critique of the claim that great men drive the course of events. Great men are not great, Tolstoy contends, nor do they drive the course of events: they merely think that they do, due to an incorrigible combination of conceitedness and incognizance. The illusion of their pervasive influence persists because it is built into the narratives we tell about events, in the form of unexamined assumptions about---inter alia---power, plans, and planners. Tolstoy subjects these tacit suppositions to critical scrutiny and constructs a coherent counter-narrative that neatly contradicts nearly everything that Great Man stories affirm. His critique engenders an epistemological crisis that still constitutes a significant challenge to contemporary studies of leadership.},

  abstract = {A long line of philosophers and social scientists have defended and extended the curious idea that collective entities -- states and societies, cities and corporations -- are biological organisms. In this article, I study a few short but spectacular episodes from the history of that metaphor, juxtapose mappings made in one era with correspondences conjured in other epochs, and reflect upon the reasons why they differ. By adopting a historical perspective on the process whereby the notion of a `social organism' evolved from its relatively simple beginnings in ancient philosophy to its rather complex manifestations in the modern social sciences, I hope to show that there are good reasons to reconsider both Lakoff's decree that metaphors `should not be thought of as processes' and his declaration that they should instead be seen as consisting of `a fixed pattern of ontological correspondences across domains' (Lakoff, 1993:210, emphasis added). Building on ideas about metaphor that emerged during the Nineteenth Century, I argue that what may initially appear to be a fixed pattern of projections is often better understood as a temporary station in a fluid process.},

CP is never pursued in a properly theoretical way, and its practice is tailor-made for particular political and ethical conclusions.

  abstract = {In an effort to take stock of the claims put forth by advocates of game theory, this article offers an assessment that considers game theory both as a set of theoretical principles that extends rational choice theory to interdependent decision making and as a type of formal methodology. Some important strengths of game theory are identified, such as its emphasis on actors and strategic choices and its ability to generate predictions in a logically rigorous and internally consistent manner. But many shortcomings are also discussed. One shortcoming is that the effort to develop a theory of action falls short, both in the sense of failing to provide a full explanation of actions and in the sense of not applying to domains of great significance. A second shortcoming is the failure of the procedures used in formal modeling to offer guidance pertaining to a critical step in the process of modeling: the conceptualization of the model. Thus, the challenge facing scholars in comparative politics is to consider the new perspectives offered by game theory and draw upon its strengths, but to do so without losing sight of a series of old concerns in the social sciences that game theory is not suited to tackle.},

Academic employment remained stably associated with topics in the interpretive approach, but their effect is moderated by the prestige of the students' institutions. The relation between topic popularity and employability provides insight into field change and how the benefits of cultural shifts fall along the lines of institutional power.},

  abstract = {The general problem of "information foraging" in an environment about which agents have incomplete information has been explored in many fields, including cognitive psychology, neuroscience, economics, finance, ecology, and computer science. In all of these areas, the searcher aims to enhance future performance by surveying enough of existing knowledge to orient themselves in the information space. Individuals can be viewed as conducting a cognitive search in which they must balance exploration of ideas that are novel to them against exploitation of knowledge in domains in which they are already expert. In this dissertation, I present several case studies that demonstrate how reading and writing behaviors interact to construct personal knowledge bases. These studies use LDA topic modeling to represent the information environment of the texts each author read and wrote. Three studies revolve around Charles Darwin. Darwin left detailed records of every book he read for 23 years, from disembarking from the H.M.S. Beagle to just after publication of The Origin of Species. Additionally, he left copies of his drafts before publication. I characterize his reading behavior, then show how that reading behavior interacted with the drafts and subsequent revisions of The Origin of Species, and expand the dataset to include later readings and writings. Then, through a study of Thomas Jefferson's correspondence, I expand the study to non-book data. Finally, through an examination of neuroscience citation data, I move from individual behavior to collective behavior in constructing an information environment. Together, these studies reveal "the interplay between individual and collective phenomena where innovation takes place" (Tria et al. 2014).},

  abstract = {Topic models remain a black box both for modelers and for end users in many respects. From the modelers' perspective, many decisions must be made which lack clear rationales and whose interactions are unclear -- for example, how many topics the algorithms should find (K), which words to ignore (aka the ``stop list''), and whether it is adequate to run the modeling process once or multiple times, producing different results due to the algorithms that approximate the Bayesian priors. Furthermore, the results of different parameter settings are hard to analyze, summarize, and visualize, making model comparison difficult. From the end users' perspective, it is hard to understand why the models perform as they do, and information-theoretic similarity measures do not fully align with humanistic interpretation of the topics. We present the Topic Explorer, which advances the state-of-theart in topic model visualization for document-document and topic-document relations. It brings topic models to life in a way that fosters deep understanding of both corpus and models, allowing users to generate interpretive hypotheses and to suggest further experiments. Such tools are an essential step toward assessing whether topic modeling is a suitable technique for AI and cognitive modeling applications.},

  abstract = {The analysis and visualization of weighted networks pose many challenges, which have led to the development of techniques for extracting the network's backbone, a subgraph composed of only the most significant edges. Weighted edges are particularly common in bipartite projections (e.g. networks of coauthorship, co-attendance, co-sponsorship), which are often used as proxies for one-mode networks where direct measurement is impractical or impossible (e.g. networks of collaboration, friendship, alliance). However, extracting the backbone of bipartite projections requires special care. This paper reviews existing methods for extracting the backbone from bipartite projections, and proposes a new method that aims to overcome their limitations. The stochastic degree sequence model (SDSM) involves the construction of empirical edge weight distributions from random bipartite networks with stochastic marginals, and is demonstrated using data on bill sponsorship in the 108th U.S. Senate. The extracted backbone's validity as a network reflecting political alliances and antagonisms is established through comparisons with data on political party affiliations and political ideologies, which offer an empirical ground-truth. The projection and backbone extraction methods discussed in this paper can be performed using the -onemode- command in Stata.},

  abstract = {The availability of historical textual corpora has led to the study of words' frequency along the historical time line, as representing the public's focus of attention over time. However, studying of the dynamics of words' meaning is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a methodology for studying the historical trajectory of words' meaning through Tsallis entropy. First, we present the idea that the meaning of a word may be studied through the entropy of its embedding. Using two historical case studies, we show that this entropy measure is correlated with the intensity in which a word is used. More importantly, we show that using Tsallis entropy with a superadditive entropy index may provide a better estimation of a word's frequency of use than using Shannon entropy. We explain this finding as resulting from an increasing redundancy between the words that comprise the semantic field of the target word and develop a new measure of redundancy between words. Using this measure, which relies on the Tsallis version of the Kullback--Leibler divergence, we show that the evolving meaning of a word involves the dynamics of increasing redundancy between components of its semantic field. The proposed methodology may enrich the toolkit of researchers who study the dynamics of word senses.},

Previous work indicates that a robust approach to this problem is the maximization of the benefit function known as ``modularity'' over possible divisions of a network. Here we show that this maximization process can be written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix we call the modularity matrix, which plays a role in community detection similar to that played by the graph Laplacian in graph partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a centrality measure that identifies vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong. The algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with applications to a variety of real-world complex networks.},

The vast majority of math search systems that adopt conventional text retrieval techniques are ineffective in searching math expressions. In this paper, we propose a lattice-based approach for math search. The proposed approach is based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), which is a powerful data analysis technique. In the proposed approach, math expressions are first converted into the corresponding MathML representation, from which math features are extracted. Next, the extracted features are used to construct a mathematical concept lattice. At the query time, the query expression is processed and inserted into the mathematical concept lattice, and the relevant expressions are retrieved and ranked. Finally, search results can be visualized and nevigated via a dynamic graph, thanks to the lattice structure. The proposed latticebased math search approach is benchmarked against a conventional best match retrieval technique and results show it to be almost 10\% better in terms of F1 for the top 30 retrieved results.},

  abstract = {Over 25 hundred years ago the Chinese scholar Sun Tzu, in The Art of War, attempted to codify the general strategic character of conflict and, in the process, offer practical advice about how to win military conflicts. His advice is credited with having greatly influenced both Japanese military and business practices, as well as Mao Tse-Tung's approach to conflict and revolution. The question, however, is whether or to what extent Sun Tzu anticipated the implications of the contemporary theory of conflict - game theory. The thesis of this essay is that he can be credited with having anticipated the concepts of dominant, minmax, and mixed strategies, but that he failed to intuit the full implications of the notion of equilibrium strategies. Thus, while he offers a partial resolution of 'he-thinks-that-I-think' regresses, his advice remains vulnerable to a more complete strategic analysis. In judging Sun Tzu's contribution to our understanding of strategy, however, we should keep in mind that resolving circular reasoning in some circumstances requires the use of advanced principles of probability theory and mathematics, and so we should not be surprised to learn that Sun Tzu's treatment of information is incomplete. Indeed, we should marvel at the fact that he understood intuitively as much as he did.},

Obwohl wenig Einigkeit {\"u}ber die eigentliche Natur der Trennung besteht, spielt sie eine wichtige Rolle im philosophischen Berufsleben. Klarheit {\"u}ber die Topologie dieser Trennung zu erreichen, ist dementsprechend von gro{\ss}em Interesse. Dennoch besteht in der Literatur eine ausgesprochene Uneinigkeit {\"u}ber eine Reihe von basalen Fragen: Wann hat die Spaltung ihren Anfang genommen? Hat sie im einundzwanzigsten Jahrhundert {\"u}berhaupt noch Bestand? In der vorliegenden Arbeit schlagen wir eine Methode zur Beantwortung solcher grenz{\"u}berschreitenden, globalen Fragestellungen vor. Mithilfe eines multilingualen Sprachmodells (PhilroBERTa), welches wir auf philosophischen Texten feintrainieren generieren wir Textvektoren von 288.546 philosophischen Texten aus den vergangenen hundert Jahren. In diesem Vektorraum identifizieren wir die Achse welche der kontinental-/-analytischen Unterscheidung entspricht. Indem wir die Positionierung der einzelnen Artikel auf dieser Achse erheben, k{\"o}nnen wir eine erste quantitative Einsch{\"a}tzungen der Topologie der analytisch/kontinentalen-Trennung vorschlagen."

  title = {A Novel Metric Reveals Previously Unrecognized Distortion in Dimensionality Reduction of {{scRNA-Seq}} Data},
  year = {2019},
  pages = {30},
  abstract = {High-dimensional data are becoming increasingly common in nearly all areas of science. Developing approaches to analyze these data and understand their meaning is a pressing issue. This is particularly true for the rapidly growing field of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), a technique that simultaneously measures the expression of tens of thousands of genes in thousands to millions of single cells. The emerging consensus for analysis workflows reduces the dimensionality of the dataset before performing downstream analysis, such as assignment of cell types. One problem with this approach is that dimensionality reduction can introduce substantial distortion into the data; consider the familiar example of trying to represent the three-dimensional earth as a two-dimensional map. It is currently unclear if such distortion affects analysis of scRNA-Seq data sets. Here, we introduce a straightforward approach to quantifying this distortion by comparing the local neighborhoods of points before and after dimensionality reduction. We found that popular techniques like t-SNE and UMAP introduce significant distortion even for relatively simple geometries such as simulated hyperspheres. For scRNA-Seq data, we found the distortion in local neighborhoods was greater than 95\% in the 2- and 3-dimensional space typically used for downstream analysis. This high level of distortion can readily introduce important errors into cell type identification, pseudotime ordering, and other analyses that rely on local relationships. We found that principal component analysis can generate accurate embeddings of the data, but only when using dimensionalities that are much higher than typically used in scRNASeq analysis. We suggest approaches to take these findings into account and call for a new generation of dimensional reduction algorithms that can accurately embed high dimensional data in its true latent dimension.},

Visual tools bridge the gap between algorithmic approaches and the cognitive skills of investigators. Addressing this need has become crucial in genomics, as biomedical research is increasingly data-driven and many studies lack well-defined hypotheses. A key challenge in data-driven research is to discover unexpected patterns and to formulate hypotheses in an unbiased manner in vast amounts of genomic and other associated data. Over the past two decades, this has driven the development of numerous data visualization techniques and tools for visualizing genomic data. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we propose taxonomies for data, visualization, and tasks involved in genomic data visualization. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of published genomic visualization tools in the context of the proposed taxonomies.},

Turning his keen intelligence to Polynesian societies in the early periods of European contact and colonization, Obeyesekere deconstructs Western eyewitness accounts, carefully examining their origins and treating them as a species of fiction writing and seamen's yarns. Cannibalism is less a social or cultural fact than a mythic representation of European writing that reflects much more the realities of European societies and their fascination with the practice of cannibalism, he argues. And while very limited forms of cannibalism might have occurred in Polynesian societies, they were largely in connection with human sacrifice and carried out by a select community in well-defined sacramental rituals. Cannibal Talk considers how the colonial intrusion produced a complex self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the fantasy of cannibalism became a reality as natives on occasion began to eat both Europeans and their own enemies in acts of'conspicuous anthropophagy.'},

Addressing intersectionality theory through quantitative methods has proven difficult. Concerns have been raised about the sample size one would need in order to responsibly tease out evidence for the claims of intersectionality theorists. What is more, theorists have expressed concern about our ability to formulate novel intersectional hypotheses in a non-ad-hoc manner. We argue that simulation methods can help address these, and other, methodological problems, because they can generate novel hypotheses about causal dependencies in a relatively cheap way, and can thus guide future empirical work. We illustrate this point using models which show that intersectional oppression can arise under conditions where social groups are disadvantaged in the emergence of bargaining norms. As we show, intersectional disadvantage can arise even when actors from all social categories are completely identical in terms of preferences and abilities. And when actors behave in ways that reflect stronger intersectional identities, the potential for disadvantage increases. As we note, this exploration illustrates the usefulness of idealized models to real-world inquiry.},

The first set of research stems from the specialized field. We show that the existing interpretive literature captures relatively well its main divisions. The second set is made of publications that are coded as `Economic Methodology' by the JEL Classification System, but that are otherwise not part of the specialized field. We find that this other philosophy of economics has concerns that are different from field publications, including a continuing interest for the heterodoxy in economics. The existing interpretive literature has failed to recognize this diversity among philosophies of economics.},

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classificationof existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.},

This book tells, with 'brutal clarity', the disquieting story of how a loose-knit group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades that link smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole. It is the troubling story of how a cadre of influential scientists have clouded public understanding of scientific facts to advance a political and economic agenda. The U.S. scientific community has long led the world in research on such areas as public health, environmental science, and issues affecting quality of life. Our scientists have produced landmark studies on the dangers of DDT, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming. But at the same time, a small yet potent subset of this community leads the world in vehement denial of these dangers. Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly, some of the same figures who have claimed that the science of global warming is "not settled" denied the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole. "Doubt is our product," wrote one tobacco executive. These "experts" supplied it. The authors, both historians of science, roll back the rug on this dark corner of the American scientific community, showing how ideology and corporate interests, aided by a too-compliant media, have skewed public understanding of some of the most pressing issues of our era. -- from Back Cover},

Since then, numerous independent studies have affirmed that anthropogenic climate change is underway, and the meta-conclusion that there is a broad expert consensus on this point. It has also been demonstrated that most of the challenges to this claim come from interested parties outside the scientific community. But even if we allow that the challenges to climate science are politically or economically motivated, it does not prove that the scientific consensus is correct. In other words, even if we accept the fact of scientific consensus, how do we know that this consensus is not wrong? This chapter addresses this question by examining a set of criteria that philosophers have traditionally or recently identified as possible bases for trust in scientific conclusions, and shows that climate science meets all of these criteria. Thus, while there is no way to know for sure that scientists are correct in their conclusions, the various means we have to test and evaluate scientific claims lead to the conclusion that, so far as we are able to tell, it is most likely that scientists are not wrong about the reality of anthropogenic climate change.},

  abstract = {In the early 1980s, a doctoral candidate at Indiana University, teaching for the first time an undergraduate course in organizational behavior, was casting about for some device with which to rouse his students' interest in ``leadership.'' Deciding to play a really long shot, he called IU's Athletic Office in an attempt to reach basketball coach Bob Knight and engage him as a guest speaker for the class. The coach was out of the office, so the instructor left a message indicating his request and waited for a call. No return call came for several days. The instructor was not really surprised; he knew all along the odds were against Coach Knight having the time to provide this service, however much he might be interested in doing it. Then, to his astonishment, Knight called a couple of days before the topic of leadership was scheduled and said yes, he would be glad to speak to the class on leadership, and that they should come to a classroom at the athletic facilities complex. As Knight took the podium, he told the business students, ``The first thing you people need to know about leadership is that most of you simply don't have it in you.'' Chances are good that this statement blatantly contradicted what the students had read in their textbooks. The fashionable party line in those days was ``leadership is not a trait, it is learned behavior and has little to do with innate personal qualities. '' The Great Man (or Woman) notion of leadership was said to be anecdotal and ``unscientific.'' Fortunately, in light of new evidence, a fair assessment of the old data, and, most notably, a willingness to admit what everyday observation and common sense tell us, management scholars and organizational psychologists now feel comfortable again with the idea that some people-whether by innate qualities, distinctive experiences, or some combination of both-simply have more than others of this ``right stuff'' required for leadership. In other words, it seems we have caught up with Coach Knight in this regard.},

  abstract = {Agent-based Models (ABMs) are valuable tools for policy analysis. ABMs help analysts explore the emergent consequences of policy interventions in multi-agent decision-making settings. But the validity of inferences drawn from ABM explorations depends on the quality of the ABM agents' behavioral models. Standard specifications of agent behavioral models rely either on heuristic decision-making rules or on regressions trained on past data. Both prior specification modes have limitations. This paper examines the value of reinforcement learning (RL) models as adaptive, high-performing, and behaviorally-valid models of agent decision-making in ABMs. We test the hypothesis that RL agents are effective as utility-maximizing agents in policy ABMs. We also address the problem of adapting RL algorithms to handle multi-agency in games by adapting and extending methods from recent literature. We evaluate the performance of such RL-based ABM agents via experiments on two policy-relevant ABMs: a minority game ABM and an ABM of Influenza Transmission. We run some analytic experiments on our AI-equipped ABMs e.g. explorations of the effects of behavioral heterogeneity in a population and the emergence of synchronization in a population. The experiments show that RL behavioral models are effective at producing rewardseeking or reward-maximizing behaviors in ABM agents. Furthermore, RL behavioral models can learn to outperform the default adaptive behavioral models in the two ABMs examined. These results suggest that the RL formalism can be an efficient default abstraction for behavioral models in ABMs. The core of the argument is that the RL formalism cleanly and efficiently represents reward-seeking behavior in intelligent agents. Furthermore, the RL formalism allows modelers to specify behavioral models in a way that is agnostic to the agent's detailed internal structure of decision-making, which is often unidentifiable.},

  abstract = {How is knowledge created at the intersections between basic science, biotechnology, and industry? Gene drives are an interesting example, as they combine a long-standing interest with a recent technological breakthrough and a new set of commercial applications. Gene drives are genes engineered such that they are preferentially inherited at a frequency greater than the typical Mendelian fifty percent ratio. During the historical and conceptual evolution of gene drives beginning in the 1960s, there have been many innovations and publications. Along with that, gene drive science developed considerable public attention, explosion of new scientists, and variation in the way the topic is discussed. It is now time to look at this new organization of science using a systematic approach to characterize the system that has enabled knowledge to grow in this scientific field. This project breaks new ground in how knowledge advances in genetic engineering science, and how scientists understand what a ``gene drive'' is through analysis of language, communities, and other social factors. In effect, this research will advance multiple fields and enable a deeper understanding of knowledge and complexity. This project documents patterns of publication, collaborative relationships, linguistic variation, innovation, and knowledge expansion. The results of computational analysis provide an in-depth and complete characterization of the structure, dynamics, and evolution of scientific knowledge found in the gene drive technology. Further, time series analysis of the multiple layers of discourse enabled a diachronic connective mapping of collaborative relationships and tracked linguistic variation and change, highlighting where ambiguous language may appear, improving and creating more cohesive scientific language. Overall, depicting the structure, dynamics, and evolution of scientific knowledge during a novel eruption of scientific complexity can shed light on the factors that can lead to: (1) improved scientific communication, (2) reduction of scientific progress, (3) new knowledge, and (4) novel collaborative relationships. Therefore, characterizing the current technological, methodological, and social contexts that can influence scientific knowledge.},

  abstract = {Dimension-reduction methods, such as t-SNE or UMAP, are widely used when exploring high-dimensional data describing many entities, for example, RNA-seq data for many single cells. However, dimension reduction is commonly prone to introducing artifacts, and we hence need means to see where a dimension-reduced embedding is a faithful representation of the local neighborhood and where it is not. We present Sleepwalk, a simple but powerful tool that allows the user to interactively explore an embedding, using color to depict original or any other distances from all points to the cell under the mouse cursor. We show how this approach not only highlights distortions but also reveals otherwise hidden characteristics of the data, and how Sleepwalk's comparative modes help integrate multisample data and understand differences between embedding and preprocessing methods. Sleepwalk is a versatile and intuitive tool that unlocks the full power of dimension reduction and will be of value not only in single-cell RNA-seq but also in any other area with matrix-shaped big data.},

  abstract = {Recently, the diffusion of the so-called "new intellectual history" led to the dismissal of the old school of the "history of ideas" on the basis of its ahistorical nature (the view of ideas as eternal entities). This formulation is actually misleading, missing the core of the transformation produced in the field. It is not true that the history of ideas simply ignored the fact that the meaning of ideas changes over time. The issue at stake here is really not how ideas changed (the mere description of the semantic transformation they underwent historically), but rather why they do. The study of the German tradition of intellectual history serves in this essay as a basis to illustrate the meaning and significance of the recent turn from ideas as its object. In the process of trying to account for the source of contingency of conceptual formations, it will open our horizon to the complex nature of the ways by which we invest the world with meaning. That is, it will disclose the presence of different layers of symbolic reality lying beneath the surface level of "ideas," and analyze their differential nature and functions. It will also show the reasons for the ultimate failure of the "history of ideas" approach, why discourses can never achieve their vocation to constitute themselves as selfenclosed, rationally integrated systems, thereby expelling contingency from their realm. In sum, it will show why historicity is not merely something that comes to intellectual history from without (as a by-product of social history or as the result of the action of an external agent), as the history of ideas assumed, but is a constitutive dimension of it.},

The essay shows that the dense compound of context and conflict in Koselleck's thought springs from Carl Schmitt's political theory and also forms an important point of continuity between Koselleck's early work and his later methodological writings. The formalized assumption of conflict, somewhat problematically, binds Koselleckian conceptual history to a particular conception of politics, one that sees politics ultimately as struggle and conflict. Once the historical-theoretical contingency of this conception is recognized, it becomes both possible and necessary to reassess the role of conflict in the methodology of conceptual history.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Our aim in this study was to understand how genetics ideas are appropriated and mobilized online toward the political projects of White nationalism and the alt right. Studying three different online venues, we investigated how genetics is used to support racial realism, hereditarianism, and racial hierarchy. We analyzed how these ideas are connected to political and metapolitical projects. In addition, we examined the strategies used to build authority for these interpretations. Methods: We analyze three online venues in which genetics has been mobilized to advance racial realism and hereditarian explanations of racial differences. These were (a) the use of genetic ancestry tests in online nationalist discussions, (b) blogs and other venues in which the human biodiversity ideas are articulated, (c) activities surrounding the OpenPsych collection of online journals. Ethnographic and interpretive methods were applied to investigate scientific and political meanings of efforts to mobilize genetic ideas. Results: We found that White nationalists use genetic ancestry tests to align White identity with ideas of racial purity and diversity, educating each other about genetics, and debating the boundaries of Whiteness. ``Human biodiversity'' has been mobilized as a movement to catalog and create hereditarian ideas about racial differences and to distribute them as ``red pills'' to transform online discourse. The OpenPsych journals have allowed amateur hereditarian psychologists to publish papers, coordinate activity, and legitimate their project at the academic margins. Conclusions: These various appropriations of genetics aim to further racial realism and hereditarian explanations of racial social and behavioral differences. Beyond these substantive aims, on a ``metapolitical'' level, they serve to reframe concepts and standards for political and scientific discussion of race, challenge structures of academic legitimacy and expertise, and build a cadre of ideological foot soldiers armed with an argumentative toolkit. As professional anthropologists and geneticists aim to accurately communicate their science and its implications for understanding human differences to the public, they must contend with these substantive claims and metapolitical contexts.},

To understand if and how morphosyntactic alignment affects contextual embedding spaces, we train classifiers to recover the subjecthood of mBERT embeddings in transitive sentences (which do not contain overt information about morphosyntactic alignment) and then evaluate them zero-shot on intransitive sentences (where subjecthood classification depends on alignment), within and across languages. We find that the resulting classifier distributions reflect the morphosyntactic alignment of their training languages. Our results demonstrate that mBERT representations are influenced by high-level grammatical features that are not manifested in any one input sentence, and that this is robust across languages. Further examining the characteristics that our classifiers rely on, we find that features such as passive voice, animacy and case strongly correlate with classification decisions, suggesting that mBERT does not encode subjecthood purely syntactically, but that subjecthood embedding is continuous and dependent on semantic and discourse factors, as is proposed in much of the functional linguistics literature. Together, these results provide insight into how grammatical features manifest in contextual embedding spaces, at a level of abstraction not covered by previous work.},

Topological Deep Learning (TDL) provides a comprehensive framework to process and extract knowledge from data associated with these systems, such as predicting the social community to which an individual belongs or predicting whether a protein can be a reasonable target for drug development. TDL has demonstrated theoretical and practical advantages that hold the promise of breaking ground in the applied sciences and beyond. However, the rapid growth of the TDL literature has also led to a lack of unification in notation and language across Topological Neural Network (TNN) architectures. This presents a real obstacle for building upon existing works and for deploying TNNs to new real-world problems. To address this issue, we provide an accessible introduction to TDL, and compare the recently published TNNs using a unified mathematical and graphical notation. Through an intuitive and critical review of the emerging field of TDL, we extract valuable insights into current challenges and exciting opportunities for future development.},

  abstract = {Thymus development, cell by cell The human thymus is the organ responsible for the maturation of many types of T cells, which are immune cells that protect us from infection. However, it is not well known how these cells develop with a full immune complement that contains the necessary variation to protect us from a variety of pathogens. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing on more than 250,000 cells, Park et al. examined the changes that occur in the thymus over the course of a human life. They found that development occurs in a coordinated manner among immune cells and with their developmental microenvironment. These data allowed for the creation of models of how T cells with different specific immune functions develop in humans. Science, this issue p. eaay3224 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe thymus is the critical organ for T cell development and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire formation, which shapes the landscape of adaptive immunity. T cell development in the thymus is spatially coordinated, and this process is orchestrated by diverse cell types constituting the thymic microenvironment. Although the thymus has been extensively studied using diverse animal models, human immunity cannot be understood without a detailed atlas of the human thymus. RATIONALETo provide a comprehensive atlas of thymic cells across human life, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using dissociated cells from human thymus during development, childhood, and adult life. We sampled 15 embryonic and fetal thymi spanning thymic developmental stages between 7 and 17 post-conception weeks, as well as nine postnatal thymi from pediatric and adult individuals. Diverse sorting schemes were applied to increase the coverage on underrepresented cell populations. Using the marker genes obtained from single-cell transcriptomes, we spatially localized cell states by single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). To provide a systematic comparison between human and mouse, we also generated single-cell data on postnatal mouse thymi and combined this with preexisting mouse datasets. Finally, to investigate the bias in the recombination and selection of human TCR repertoires, we enriched the TCR sequences for single-cell library generation. RESULTSWe identified more than 50 different cell states in the human thymus. Human thymus cell states dynamically change in abundance and gene expression profiles across development and during pediatric and adult life. We identified novel subpopulations of human thymic fibroblasts and epithelial cells and located them in situ. We computationally predicted the trajectory of human T cell development from early progenitors in the hematopoietic fetal liver into diverse mature T cell types. Using this trajectory, we constructed a framework of putative transcription factors driving T cell fate determination. Among thymic unconventional T cells, we noted a distinct subset of CD8{$\alpha\alpha$}+ T cells, which is marked by GNG4 expression and located in the perimedullary region of the thymus. This subset expressed high levels of XCL1 and colocalized with XCR1+ dendritic cells. Comparison of human and mouse thymic cells revealed divergent gene expression profiles of these unconventional T cell types. Finally, we identified a strong bias in human VDJ usage shaped by recombination and multiple rounds of selection, including a TCR{$\alpha$} V-J bias for CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSIONOur single-cell transcriptome profile of the thymus across the human lifetime and across species provides a high-resolution census of T cell development within the native tissue microenvironment. Systematic comparison between the human and mouse thymus highlights human-specific cell states and gene expression signatures. Our detailed cellular network of the thymic niche for T cell development will aid the establishment of in vitro organoid culture models that faithfully recapitulate human in vivo thymic tissue. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.uaccess.univie.ac.at/content/sci/367/6480/eaay3224/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Constructing the human thymus cell atlas.We analyzed human thymic cells across development and postnatal life using scRNA-seq and spatial methods to delineate the diversity of thymic-derived T cells and the localization of cells constituting the thymus microenvironment. With T cell development trajectory reconstituted at single-cell resolution combined with TCR sequence, we investigated the bias in the VDJ recombination and selection of human TCR repertoires. Finally, we provide a systematic comparison between human and mouse thymic cell atlases. The thymus provides a nurturing environment for the differentiation and selection of T cells, a process orchestrated by their interaction with multiple thymic cell types. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a cell census of the human thymus across the life span and to reconstruct T cell differentiation trajectories and T cell receptor (TCR) recombination kinetics. Using this approach, we identified and located in situ CD8{$\alpha\alpha$}+ T cell populations, thymic fibroblast subtypes, and activated dendritic cell states. In addition, we reveal a bias in TCR recombination and selection, which is attributed to genomic position and the kinetics of lineage commitment. Taken together, our data provide a comprehensive atlas of the human thymus across the life span with new insights into human T cell development. Single-cell RNA profiles of the human thymus over time elucidate aspects of human immunological T cell development.

  abstract = {We test whether large language models (LLMs) can be used to simulate human participants in social-science studies. To do this, we ran replications of 14 studies from the Many Labs 2 replication project with OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model, colloquially known as GPT-3.5. Based on our pre-registered analyses, we find that among the eight studies we could analyse, our GPT sample replicated 37.5\% of the original results and 37.5\% of the Many Labs 2 results. However, we were unable to analyse the remaining six studies due to an unexpected phenomenon we call the ``correct answer'' effect. Different runs of GPT-3.5 answered nuanced questions probing political orientation, economic preference, judgement, and moral philosophy with zero or near-zero variation in responses: with the supposedly ``correct answer.'' In one exploratory follow-up study, we found that a ``correct answer'' was robust to changing the demographic details that precede the prompt. In another, we found that most but not all ``correct answers'' were robust to changing the order of answer choices. One of our most striking findings occurred in our replication of the Moral Foundations Theory survey results, where we found GPT-3.5 identifying as a political conservative in 99.6\% of the cases, and as a liberal in 99.3\% of the cases in the reverse-order condition. However, both self-reported `GPT conservatives' and `GPT liberals' showed right-leaning moral foundations. Our results cast doubts on the validity of using LLMs as a general replacement for human participants in the social sciences. Our results also raise concerns that a hypothetical AI-led future may be subject to a diminished diversity of thought.},

  abstract = {Given the large size and complexity of most biochemical regulation and signaling networks, there is a non-trivial relationship between the micro-level logic of component interactions and the observed macro-dynamics. Here we address this issue by formalizing the existing concept of pathway modules, which are sequences of state updates that are guaranteed to occur (barring outside interference) in the dynamics of automata networks after the perturbation of a subset of driver nodes. We present a novel algorithm to automatically extract pathway modules from networks and we characterize the interactions that may take place between modules. This methodology uses only the causal logic of individual node variables (micro-dynamics) without the need to compute the dynamical landscape of the networks (macro-dynamics). Specifically, we identify complex modules, which maximize pathway length and require synergy between their components. This allows us to propose a new take on dynamical modularity that partitions complex networks into causal pathways of variables that are guaranteed to transition to specific states given a perturbation to a set of driver nodes. Thus, the same node variable can take part in distinct modules depending on the state it takes. Our measure of dynamical modularity of a network is then inversely proportional to the overlap among complex modules and maximal when complex modules are completely decouplable from one another in the network dynamics. We estimate dynamical modularity for several genetic regulatory networks, including the Drosophila melanogaster segment-polarity network. We discuss how identifying complex modules and the dynamical modularity portrait of networks explains the macro-dynamics of biological networks, such as uncovering the (more or less) decouplable building blocks of emergent computation (or collective behavior) in biochemical regulation and signaling.},

  abstract = {In this work we study the coupled dynamics of social balance and opinion formation. We propose a model where agents form opinions under bounded confidence, but only considering the opinions of their friends. The signs of social ties -friendships and enmities- evolve seeking for social balance, taking into account how similar agents' opinions are. We consider both the case where opinions have one and two dimensions. We find that our dynamics produces the segregation of agents into two cliques, with the opinions of agents in one clique differing from those in the other. Depending on the level of bounded confidence, the dynamics can produce either consensus of opinions within each clique or the coexistence of several opinion clusters in a clique. For the uni-dimensional case, the opinions in one clique are all below the opinions in the other clique, hence defining a ``left clique'' and a ``right clique''. In the two-dimensional case, our numerical results suggest that the two cliques are separated by a hyperplane in the opinion space. We also show that the phenomenon of unidimensional opinions identified by DeMarzo, Vayanos and Zwiebel (Q J Econ 2003) extends partially to our dynamics. Finally, in the context of politics, we comment about the possible relation of our results to the fragmentation of an ideology and the emergence of new political parties.},

  abstract = {Psychological science relies on behavioral measures to assess cognitive processing; however, the field has not yet developed a tradition of routinely examining the reliability of these behavioral measures. Reliable measures are essential to draw robust inferences from statistical analyses, and subpar reliability has severe implications for measures' validity and interpretation. Without examining and reporting the reliability of measurements used in an analysis, it is nearly impossible to ascertain whether results are robust or have arisen largely from measurement error. In this article, we propose that researchers adopt a standard practice of estimating and reporting the reliability of behavioral assessments of cognitive processing. We illustrate the need for this practice using an example from experimental psychopathology, the dot-probe task, although we argue that reporting reliability is relevant across fields (e.g., social cognition and cognitive psychology). We explore several implications of low measurement reliability and the detrimental impact that failure to assess measurement reliability has on interpretability and comparison of results and therefore research quality. We argue that researchers in the field of cognition need to report measurement reliability as routine practice so that more reliable assessment tools can be developed. To provide some guidance on estimating and reporting reliability, we describe the use of bootstrapped split-half estimation and intraclass correlation coefficients to estimate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. For future researchers to build upon current results, it is imperative that all researchers provide psychometric information sufficient for estimating the accuracy of inferences and informing further development of cognitive-behavioral assessments.},

We explore the role of virtues as well as vices in scientific inquiry and their beneficial effects in the context of theory choice. We argue that vices can play a role in widening the set of potential candidate theories and support our claim with historical examples and normative arguments from formal social epistemology.

Research suggests that, contrary to concerns voiced by many observers, parents' sexual orientation has little if any direct impact on children's development. Even so, some distinctive qualities of experiences in families of lesbian and gay parents have been noted, and their implications are not fully understood. Moreover, research on individual differences among families headed by lesbian mothers and gay fathers, and their possible impact on children, is still in its early phases. In this article, I provide an overview of research in this area and offer suggestions for further studies.},

  abstract = {Ragnar Frisch, one of the greatest proponents of scientific methodology in economics, warned that one cannot unreflectively apply the methodology of natural science to economics. I will argue that the unreflective application of logical positivism to welfare economics in the mid-twentieth century did great harm to that discipline. It led Arrow to impose the independence of irrelevant alternatives on any ethical method of preference aggregation, which I join many others in considering an unfortunate idea. It further caused Arrow and most of the profession to adopt an unnecessary and unnatural interpretation of his Impossibility Theorem. Viewing that theorem as a disturbing paradox encouraged many in the profession to consider theoretical work on social welfare and social choice an unpromising dead end. Samuelson's positivist-inspired criterion for a meaningful concept has left us without a fully developed and widely accepted language for discussing utility information richer than that which is generated by standard revealed preference. The second half of the paper wades into that forbidden territory, examining different ways that measurability, intensity, cardinality and comparability of utility are used in the literature and searching for alternative ways of understanding them.},

  abstract = {Journal of the History of Biology provides a fifty-year long record for examining the evolution of the history of biology as a scholarly discipline. In this paper, we present a new dataset and preliminary quantitative analysis of the thematic content of JHB from the perspectives of geography, organisms, and thematic fields. The geographic diversity of authors whose work appears in JHB has increased steadily since 1968, but the geographic coverage of the content of JHB articles remains strongly lopsided toward the United States, United Kingdom, and western Europe and has diversified much less dramatically over time. The taxonomic diversity of organisms discussed in JHB increased steadily between 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later years, mirroring broader patterns of diversification previously reported in the biomedical research literature. Finally, we used a combination of topic modeling and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques to develop a model of multi-article fields within JHB. We found evidence for directional changes in the representation of fields on multiple scales. The diversity of JHB with regard to the representation of thematic fields has increased overall, with most of that diversification occurring in recent years. Drawing on the dataset generated in the course of this analysis, as well as web services in the emerging digital history and philosophy of science ecosystem, we have developed an interactive web platform for exploring the content of JHB, and we provide a brief overview of the platform in this article. As a whole, the data and analyses presented here provide a starting-place for further critical reflection on the evolution of the history of biology over the past half-century.},

This growing bounty of data would be of little use, however, without quality tools with which to analyze it. Fortunately, the growth in available data is matched by the extensive development of automated analysis tools. For the beginner, this wide variety of data sources and tools can be overwhelming.

  abstract = {Evolutionary theory in the late nineteenth century was marked by controversy over the way in which Darwin's insights could be reconciled with theories of heredity, particularly following the rediscovery of the work of Mendel. Darwin's proposal of common descent was quickly accepted, but natural selection's adoption was delayed as a result of this debate. Two schools of thought rapidly developed: one (the ``biometricians'') using statistics to describe patterns of inheritance, and the other (the ``Batesonians,'' later the ``Mendelians'') using morphological study and searching for discontinuous variation. The traditional history of this debate has focused on its key players (most notably William Bateson, Karl Pearson, and W.F.R. Weldon). Sociologists of science have helpfully expanded this picture to include a wider array of biologists and emphasize the role of the ``conversion'' of lesser-known biologists from biometry to Mendelism. In this chapter, I will expand our picture further, by considering the structure of the debate as it developed in the articles and correspondence of Nature. The ``network of discourse'' in this literature, as revealed by digital tools, shows us surprising features of the way this argument unfolded. Far from being a central topic in the biology literature of the day, as historians often have assumed, those arguing over theories of heredity recede into the background, engaging with fewer other members of their fields. While this digital analysis is not the end of the story, it offers us a variety of suggestive questions for future historical, philosophical, and sociological work on this crucial period in the development of evolution.},

Here we present a new approach for building a brain decoding system in which words and sentences are represented as vectors in a semantic space constructed from massive text corpora. By efficiently sampling this space to select training stimuli shown to subjects, we maximize the ability to generalize to new meanings from limited imaging data. To validate this approach, we train the system on imaging data of individual concepts, and show it can decode semantic vector representations from imaging data of sentences about a wide variety of both concrete and abstract topics from two separate datasets. These decoded representations are sufficiently detailed to distinguish even semantically similar sentences, and to capture the similarity structure of meaning relationships between sentences.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the introduction of the Transformer models sparked a revolution in natural language processing (NLP). BERT was one of the first text encoders using only the attention mechanism without any recurrent parts to achieve state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks. This paper introduces a text classifier using topological data analysis. We use BERT's attention maps transformed into attention graphs as the only input to that classifier. The model can solve tasks such as distinguishing spam from ham messages, recognizing whether a sentence is grammatically correct, or evaluating a movie review as negative or positive. It performs comparably to the BERT baseline and outperforms it on some tasks. Additionally, we propose a new method to reduce the number of BERT's attention heads considered by the topological classifier, which allows us to prune the number of heads from 144 down to as few as ten with no reduction in performance. Our work also shows that the topological model displays higher robustness against adversarial attacks than the original BERT model, which is maintained during the pruning process. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to confront topological-based models with adversarial attacks in the context of NLP.},

By understanding this process, designers and educators are better able to support and guide collaborative learning activities. This paper presents an application of our Lifespan of an Idea framework to measure engagement patterns among individuals in communal socio-technical spaces like Twitter. We correlated engagement with social participation, enabling the process of idea expression, spread, and evolution. Social participation leads to transmission of ideas from one individual to another and can be gauged in the same way as evaluating diseases. The temporal dynamics of the social participation can be modeled through the lens of epidemiological modeling. To test the plausibility of this framework, we investigated social participation on Twitter using the tweet posting patterns of individuals in three academic conferences and one long term chat space. We used a basic SIR epidemiological model, where the rate parameters were estimated through Euler's solutions to SIR model and non-linear least squares optimization technique. We discuss the differences in the social participation among individuals in these spaces based on their transition behavior into different categories of the SIR model. We also made inferences on how the total lifetime of these different twitter spaces affects the engagement among individuals. We conclude by discussing implications of this study and planned future research of refining the Lifespan of an Idea Framework.},

  abstract = {These notes were originally developed as lecture notes for a category theory course. They should be well-suited to anyone that wants to learn category theory from scratch and has a scientific mind. There is no need to know advanced mathematics, nor any of the disciplines where category theory is traditionally applied, such as algebraic geometry or theoretical computer science. The only knowledge that is assumed from the reader is linear algebra. All concepts are explained by giving concrete examples from different, non-specialized areas of mathematics (such as basic group theory, graph theory, and probability). Not every example is helpful for every reader, but hopefully every reader can find at least one helpful example per concept. The reader is encouraged to read all the examples, this way they may even learn something new about a different field. Particular emphasis is given to the Yoneda lemma and its significance, with both intuitive explanations, detailed proofs, and specific examples. Another common theme in these notes is the relationship between categories and directed multigraphs, which is treated in detail. From the applied point of view, this shows why categorical thinking can help whenever some process is taking place on a graph. Form the pure math point of view, this can be seen as the 1-dimensional first step into the theory of simplicial sets. Finally, monads and comonads are treated on an equal footing, differently to most literature in which comonads are often overlooked as "just the dual to monads". Theorems, interpretations and concrete examples are given for monads as well as for comonads.},

Building on triple helix research, we use entropy statistics to elaborate an indicator of mutual information among these dimensions that can provide indication of reduction of uncertainty. To do so, we focus on the medical context, where uncertainty poses significant challenges to the governance of innovation. We use the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of MEDLINE/PubMed to identify publications within the categories ``Diseases'' (C), ``Drugs and Chemicals'' (D), ``Analytic, Diagnostic, and Therapeutic Techniques and Equipment'' (E) and use these as knowledge representations of demand, supply, and technological capabilities, respectively. Three case-studies of medical research areas are used as representative `entry perspectives' of the medical innovation process. These are: (i) human papilloma virus, (ii) RNA interference, and (iii) magnetic resonance imaging. We find statistically significant periods of synergy among demand, supply, and technological capabilities (C-D-E) that point to three-dimensional interactions as a fundamental perspective for the understanding and governance of the uncertainty associated with medical innovation. Among the pairwise configurations in these contexts, the demand--technological capabilities (C-E) provided the strongest link, followed by the supply--demand (D-C) and the supply--technological capabilities (D-E) channels.},

Values that drive inquiry to the confirmation of predetermined conclusions can contribute to the reliability of scientific inquiry at the group level, even when they negatively affect an individual's cognition.

It also suggests that this proposal assumes a narrow, individualistic account of science that threatens to undermine the project of ensuring reliable belief-formation in science.},

Whilst learning linguistic knowledge, these models may also be storing relational knowledge present in the training data, and may be able to answer queries structured as ``fillin-the-blank'' cloze statements. Language models have many advantages over structured knowledge bases: they require no schema engineering, allow practitioners to query about an open class of relations, are easy to extend to more data, and require no human supervision to train. We present an in-depth analysis of the relational knowledge already present (without fine-tuning) in a wide range of state-of-theart pretrained language models. We find that (i) without fine-tuning, BERT contains relational knowledge competitive with traditional NLP methods that have some access to oracle knowledge, (ii) BERT also does remarkably well on open-domain question answering against a supervised baseline, and (iii) certain types of factual knowledge are learned much more readily than others by standard language model pretraining approaches. The surprisingly strong ability of these models to recall factual knowledge without any fine-tuning demonstrates their potential as unsupervised open-domain QA systems.

  abstract = {In the last decades, research in science mapping has delivered several powerful techniques, based on citation or textual analysis, for charting the intellectual organization of research fields. To map the social network underlying science and scholarship, by contrast, science mapping has mainly relied on one method, co-authorship analysis. This method, however, suffers from well-known limitations related to the practice of authorship. Moreover, it does not perform well on those fields where multi-authored publications are rare. In this study, a new method for mapping the social structure of research fields is advanced, based on the analysis of the acknowledgments of academic publications. We first discuss the standard account of the function of acknowledgments in scholarly communication, then we introduce a new interpretative framework in which the acknowledgments are intended as positioning signals exchanged by researchers. Next, we provide the formal definition of the four acknowledgments-based networks that stand at the core of the method, and we test it on a humanities field, analytic philosophy. Results show that acknowledgement-based networks allow to reconstruct the fine-grained social structure of analytic philosophy from different perspectives. Furthermore, by comparing the citation-based maps of the field with the acknowledgments-based networks, it permits to shed light on the relationship between the intellectual and social layer of analytic philosophy. We conclude by presenting practical limitations of the method and by sketching some further research lines.},

  abstract = {Grounded theories assume that there is no central module for cognition. According to this view, all cognitive phenomena, including those considered the province of amodal cognition such as reasoning, numeric, and language processing, are ultimately grounded in (and emerge from) a variety of bodily, affective, perceptual, and motor processes. The development and expression of cognition is constrained by the embodiment of cognitive agents and various contextual factors (physical and social) in which they are immersed. The grounded framework has received numerous empirical confirmations. Still, there are very few explicit computational models that implement grounding in sensory, motor and affective processes as intrinsic to cognition, and demonstrate that grounded theories can mechanistically implement higher cognitive abilities. We propose a new alliance between grounded cognition and computational modeling toward a novel multidisciplinary enterprise: Computational Grounded Cognition. We clarify the defining features of this novel approach and emphasize the importance of using the methodology of Cognitive Robotics, which permits simultaneous consideration of multiple aspects of grounding, embodiment, and situatedness, showing how they constrain the development and expression of cognition.},

  abstract = {Embodied theories are increasingly challenging traditional views of cognition by arguing that conceptual representations that constitute our knowledge are grounded in sensory and motor experiences, and processed at this sensorimotor level, rather than being represented and processed abstractly in an amodal conceptual system. Given the established empirical foundation, and the relatively underspecified theories to date, many researchers are extremely interested in embodied cognition but are clamoring for more mechanistic implementations. What is needed at this stage is a push toward explicit computational models that implement sensorimotor grounding as intrinsic to cognitive processes. In this article, six authors from varying backgrounds and approaches address issues concerning the construction of embodied computational models, and illustrate what they view as the critical current and next steps toward mechanistic theories of embodiment. The first part has the form of a dialog between two fictional characters: Ernest, the ``experimenter,'' and Mary, the ``computational modeler.'' The dialog consists of an interactive sequence of questions, requests for clarification, challenges, and (tentative) answers, and touches the most important aspects of grounded theories that should inform computational modeling and, conversely, the impact that computational modeling could have on embodied theories. The second part of the article discusses the most important open challenges for embodied computational modeling.},

  abstract = {Given the increase of publications, search for relevant papers becomes tedious. In particular, search across disciplines or schools of thinking is not supported. This is mainly due to the retrieval with keyword queries: technical terms differ in different sciences or at different times. Relevant articles might better be identified by their mathematical problem descriptions. Just looking at the equations in a paper already gives a hint to whether the paper is relevant. Hence, we propose a new approach for retrieval of mathematical expressions based on machine learning. We design an unsupervised representation learning task that combines embedding learning with self-supervised learning. Using graph convolutional neural networks we embed mathematical expression into low-dimensional vector spaces that allow efficient nearest neighbor queries. To train our models, we collect a huge dataset with over 29 million mathematical expressions from over 900,000 publications published on arXiv.org. The math is converted into an XML format, which we view as graph data. Our empirical evaluations involving a new dataset of manually annotated search queries show the benefits of using embedding models for mathematical retrieval.},

These broadly correspond with two different kinds of analogical inference, one relying on common and differing properties, the other on structural similarity. The problem of generalizing from case studies is discussed for both. Regarding the predictive mode, eliminative induction provides a natural framework. In the conceptual mode, general rules are largely lacking not least due to a number of epistemological challenges like Raphael Scholl's underdetermination problem for HPS. In agreement with ideas of Richard Burian and Peter Galison, I argue that conceptual reasoning on the basis of case studies should not aim at grand universal schemes but rather at mesoscopic or middle-range theory. In the essay, I will repeatedly draw on insights from the social sciences, in which a much more extensive reflection on case study methodology exists compared with HPS.},

Based on a sample of 65 countries over 36 years (1980 to 2016), and employing system GMM dynamic panel data estimations, four main results are worth highlighting: (1) holistic research output positively and significantly impacts on economic growth; (2) both the academic knowledge of scientific areas that most resemble capital goods (physical sciences, engineering and technology, life sciences or social sciences) or final goods (base clinical, pre-clinical and health or arts and humanities) foster economic performance; (3) the global impact of research output is particularly high in the fields of engineering and technology, social sciences, and physics; and (4) the impact of research output on economic growth occurs mainly through structural change processes involving the reallocation of resources towards the industrial sector.},

We investigate the evolution of multiplayer cooperation in mobile structured populations, where individuals move strategically on networks and interact with those they meet in groups of variable size. We find that the evolution of multiplayer cooperation primarily depends on the network topology and movement cost while using different stochastic update rules seldom influences evolutionary outcomes. Cooperation robustly co-evolves with movement on complete networks and structure has a partially detrimental effect on it. These findings contrast an established principle from evolutionary graph theory that cooperation can only emerge under some update rules and if the average degree is lower than the reward-to-cost ratio and the network far from complete. We find that group-dependent movement erases the locality of interactions, suppresses the impact of evolutionary structural viscosity on the fitness of individuals, and leads to assortative behaviour that is much more powerful than viscosity in promoting cooperation. We analyse the differences remaining between update rules through a comparison of evolutionary outcomes and fixation probabilities.},

Yet, we currently lack empirical data to inform these discussions, leaving a number of important questions unanswered. How common is it for philosophers of science to engage other communities, and in what ways are they engaging? What barriers are most prevalent when it comes to broadly disseminating one's work or collaborating with others? To what extent do philosophers of science actually value an engaged approach? Our project addresses this gap in our collective knowledge by providing empirical data regarding the state of philosophy of science today. We report the results of a survey of 299 philosophers of science about their attitudes towards and experiences with engaging those outside the discipline. Our data suggest that a significant majority of philosophers of science think it is important for non-philosophers to read and make use of their work; most are engaging with communities outside the discipline; and many think philosophy of science, as a discipline, has an obligation to ensure it has a broader impact. Interestingly, however, many of these same philosophers believe engaged work is generally undervalued in the discipline. We think these findings call for cautious optimism on the part of those who value engaged work---while there seems to be more interest in engaging other communities than many assume, significant barriers still remain.},

  abstract = {Widespread and lasting consensus has not been philosophy's fate. Indeed, one of philosophy's most striking features is its ability to accommodate ``not only different answers to philosophical questions'' but also ``total disagreement on what questions are philosophical'' (Rorty 1995, 58). It is therefore hardly surprising that philosophers' responses to this metaphilosophical predicament have been similarly varied. This article considers two recent diagnoses of philosophical diversity: Kornblith and Rescher (respectively) claim that taking philosophical disagreement seriously does not lead to metaphilosophical scepticism. The article argues that their confidence is misplaced in so far as both wrongly assume that ordinary, first-order philosophical practice and second-order metaphilosophical reflection are separate enterprises.},

  abstract = {Arguments often do not make explicit how a conclusion follows from its premises. To compensate for this lack, we enrich arguments with structured background knowledge to support knowledge-intense argumentation tasks. We present a new unsupervised method for constructing Contextualized Commonsense Knowledge Graphs (CCKGs) that selects contextually relevant knowledge from large knowledge graphs (KGs) efficiently and at high quality. Our work goes beyond context-insensitive knowledge extraction heuristics by computing semantic similarity between KG triplets and textual arguments. Using these triplet similarities as weights, we extract contextualized knowledge paths that connect a conclusion to its premise, while maximizing similarity to the argument. We combine multiple paths into a CCKG that we optionally prune to reduce noise and raise precision. Intrinsic evaluation of the quality of our graphs shows that our method is effective for (re)constructing human explanation graphs. Manual evaluations in a large-scale knowledge selection setup confirm high recall and precision of implicit CSK in the CCKGs. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CCKGs in a knowledge-insensitive argument quality rating task, outperforming strong baselines and rivaling a GPT-3 based system.},

I argue to the contrary, that the early synthesis effected by the founders of theoretical population genetics was unifying and explanatory both. Defending this requires a reconsideration of Morrison's notion of explanation. In Morrison's view, all and only answers to 'why' questions which include the 'cause or mechanism' for some phenomenon count as explanatory. In my view, mathematical demonstrations that answer 'how possibly' and 'why necessarily' questions may also count as explanatory. The authors of the synthesis explained how evolution was possible on a Mendelian system of inheritance, answered skepticism about the sufficiency of selection, and thus explained why and how a Darwinian research program was warranted. While today we take many of these claims as obvious, they required argument, and part of the explanatory work of the formal sciences is providing such arguments. Surely, Fisher and Wright had competing views as to the optimal means of generating adaptation. Nevertheless, they had common opponents and a common unifying and explanatory goal that their mathematical demonstrations served.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-SNE, can construct informative visualizations of high-dimensional data. When working with multiple data sets, a straightforward application of these methods often fails; instead of revealing underlying classes, the resulting visualizations expose data set-specific clusters. To circumvent these batch effects, we propose an embedding procedure that takes a t-SNE visualization constructed on a reference data set and uses it as a scaffold for embedding new data. The new, secondary data is embedded one data-point at the time. This prevents any interactions between instances in the secondary data and implicitly mitigates batch effects. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with an analysis of six recently published single-cell gene expression data sets containing up to tens of thousands of cells and thousands of genes. In these data sets, the batch effects are particularly strong as the data comes from different institutions and was obtained using different experimental protocols. The visualizations constructed by our proposed approach are cleared of batch effects, and the cells from secondary data sets correctly co-cluster with cells from the primary data sharing the same cell type.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Scientific understanding as a subject of inquiry has become widely discussed in philosophy of science and is often addressed through case studies from history of science. Even though these historical reconstructions engage with details of scientific practice, they usually provide only limited information about the gradual formation of understanding in ongoing processes of model and theory construction. Based on a qualitative ethnographic study of an ecological research project, this article shifts attention from understanding in the context of historical case studies to evidence of current case studies. By taking de Regt's (Understanding scientific understanding. Oxford University Press, New York, 2017) contextual theory of scientific understanding into the field, it confirms core tenets of the contextual theory (e.g. the crucial role of visualization and visualizability) suggesting a normative character with respect to scientific activities. However, the case study also shows the limitations of de Regt's latest version of this theory as an attempt to explain the development of understanding in current practice. This article provides a model representing the emergence of scientific understanding that exposes main features of scientific understanding such as its gradual formation, its relation to skills and imagination, and its capacity for knowledge selectivity. The ethnographic evidence presented here supports the claim that something unique can be learned by looking into ongoing research practices that can't be gained by studying historical case studies.},

This approach uses an animated node-link diagram showing the citation network accumulated around the researcher over the course of the career in concert with key indicators, highlighting influence both within and across fields. We developed our design in collaboration with one funding organization---the Pew Biomedical Scholars program---but the methods are generalizable to visualizations of scholarly influence. We applied the design method to the Microsoft Academic Graph, which includes more than 120 million publications.

  abstract = {Reasoning is the ability to make inferences, and automated reasoningis concerned with the building of computing systems that automate thisprocess. Although the overall goal is to mechanize different forms ofreasoning, the term has largely been identified with valid deductivereasoning as practiced in mathematics and formal logic. In thisrespect, automated reasoning is akin to mechanical theorem proving.Building an automated reasoning program means providing an algorithmicdescription to a formal calculus so that it can be implemented on acomputer to prove theorems of the calculus in an efficient manner.Important aspects of this exercise involve defining the class ofproblems the program will be required to solve, deciding what languagewill be used by the program to represent the information given to itas well as new information inferred by the program, specifying themechanism that the program will use to conduct deductive inferences,and figuring out how to perform all these computations efficiently.While basic research work continues in order to provide the necessarytheoretical framework, the field has reached a point where automatedreasoning programs are being used by researchers to attack openquestions in mathematics and logic, provide important applications incomputing science, solve problems in engineering, and find novelapproaches to questions in exact philosophy.},

We analyze relations between syntactic parameters in terms of dimensionality, of hierarchical clustering structures, and of non-trivial loops. We show there are relations that hold across language families and additional relations that are family-specific. We then analyze the trees describing the merging structure of persistent connected components for languages in different language families and we show that they partly correlate to historical phylogenetic trees but with significant differences. We also show the existence of interesting non-trivial persistent first homology groups in various language families. We give examples where explicit generators for the persistent first homology can be identified, some of which appear to correspond to homoplasy phenomena, while others may have an explanation in terms of historical linguistics, corresponding to known cases of syntactic borrowing across different language subfamilies.},

  abstract = {The problem of computing a small vertex separator in a graph arises in the context of computing a good ordering for the parallel factorization of sparse, symmetric matrices. An algebraic approach for computing vertex separators is considered in this paper. It is, shown that lower bounds on separator sizes can be obtained in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated with a graph. The Laplacian eigenvectors of grid graphs can be computed from Kronecker products involving the eigenvectors of path graphs, and these eigenvectors can be used to compute good separators in grid graphs. A heuristic algorithm is designed to compute a vertex separator in a general graph by first computing an edge separator in the graph from an eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix, and then using a maximum matching in a subgraph to compute the vertex separator. Results on the quality of the separators computed by the spectral algorithm are presented, and these are compared with separators obtained from other algorithms for computing separators. Finally, the time required to compute the Laplacian eigenvector is reported, and the accuracy with which the eigenvector must be computed to obtain good separators is considered. The spectral algorithm has the advantage that it can be implemented on a medium-size multiprocessor in a straightforward manner.},

In this paper we apply short-term diachronic text mining to a rapidly growing corpus of scientific publications on COVID-19 captured in the CORD19 dataset in order to identify co-occurrences and analyze the behavior of potential candidate treatments. We used a data set associated with a COVID-19 drug re-purposing study from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This study identified existing candidate coronavirus treatments, including drugs and approved compounds, which had been analyzed and ranked according to their potential for blocking the ability of the SARSCOV-2 virus to invade human cells. We investigated the occurrence of these candidates in temporal instances of the CORD-19 corpus. We found that at least 25\% of the identified terms occurred in temporal instances of the corpus to the extent that their frequency and contextual dynamics could be evaluated. We identified three classes of behaviors: those where frequency and contextual shifts were small and positively correlated; those where there was no correlation between frequency and contextual changes; and those where there was a negative correlation between frequency and contextual shift. We speculate that the latter two patterns are indicative that a target candidate therapeutics is undergoing active evaluation. The patterns we detected demonstrate the potential benefits of using diachronic text mining techniques with a large dynamic text corpus to track drug-repurposing activities across international clinical and laboratory settings.},

Consequently, knowledge regarding the molecular genetic architecture of personality and to what extent it is shared across the different personality traits is limited. Using genomic-relatedness-matrix residual maximum likelihood analysis (GREML), we here estimated the heritability of the Big Five personality factors (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness for experience) in a sample of 5011 European adults from 527\,469 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. We tested for the heritability of each personality trait, as well as for the genetic overlap between the personality factors. We found significant and substantial heritability estimates for neuroticism (15\%, s.e.=0.08, P=0.04) and openness (21\%, s.e.=0.08, P{$<$}0.01), but not for extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness. The bivariate analyses showed that the variance explained by common variants entirely overlapped between neuroticism and openness (rG=1.00, P {$<$}0.001), despite low phenotypic correlation (r=-0.09, P {$<$}0.001), suggesting that the remaining unique heritability may be determined by rare or structural variants. As far as we are aware of, this is the first study estimating the shared and unique heritability of all Big Five personality traits using the GREML approach. Findings should be considered exploratory and suggest that detectable heritability estimates based on common variants is shared between neuroticism and openness to experiences.},

By contrast, others do philosophy `in' science (`PinS'), that is, they use philosophical tools to address scientific problems and to provide scientifically useful proposals. Here, we consider the evidence in favour of a trend of this nature. We proceed in two stages. First, we identify relevant authors and articles empirically with bibliometric tools, given that PinS would be likely to infiltrate science and thus to be published in scientific journals (`intervention'), cited in scientific journals (`visibility') and sometimes recognized as a scientific result by scientists (`contribution'). We show that many central figures in philosophy of science have been involved in PinS, and that some philosophers have even `specialized' in this practice. Second, we propose a conceptual definition of PinS as a process involving three conditions (raising a scientific problem, using philosophical tools to address it, and making a scientific proposal), and we ask whether the articles identified at the first stage fulfil all these conditions. We show that PinS is a distinctive, quantitatively substantial trend within philosophy of science, demonstrating the existence of a methodological continuity from science to philosophy of science.},

Studying how different species demonstrate this trait can provide clues for its evolutionary route. Indeed, recent decades saw ample scientific attempts to compare human speech, the prominent behavioral manifestation of language, with other animals' vocalizations. Diligent studies have found only elementary parallels to speech in other animals, fortifying the belief that language is uniquely human. But have we really tested this uniqueness claim? Surprisingly, a true impartial comparison between human speech and other animals' vocalizations has hardly ever been conducted. Here, I illustrate how treating humans as an equal species in vocal-communication research is expected to provide us with no evidence for human superiority in this realm. Thus, novel balanced and unbiased comparative studies are vital for identifying any unique component of human speech and language.},

We demonstrate that a metabolite provided to the parasite from the host's food can set the schedule for             Plasmodium chabaudi's             intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC). First, a large-scale screen reveals multiple rhythmic metabolites in the blood that match the timing of the IDC, but only one - the amino acid isoleucine - that malaria parasites must scavenge from host food. Second, perturbing the timing of isoleucine provision and withdrawal demonstrate that parasites use isoleucine to schedule and synchronise their replication. Thus, periodicity in the concentration of isoleucine in the blood, driven by host-feeding rhythms, explains why timing is beneficial to the parasite and how it coordinates with host rhythms. Blood-stage replication of malaria parasites is responsible for the severity of disease symptoms and fuels transmission; disrupting metabolite-sensing by parasites offers a novel intervention to reduce parasite fitness.},

  abstract = {The chemical sciences are producing an unprecedented amount of large, high-dimensional data sets containing chemical structures and associated properties. However, there are currently no algorithms to visualize such data while preserving both global and local features with a sufficient level of detail to allow for human inspection and interpretation. Here, we propose a solution to this problem with a new data visualization method, TMAP, capable of representing data sets of up to millions of data points and arbitrary high dimensionality as a two-dimensional tree (http://tmap.gdb.tools). Visualizations based on TMAP are better suited than t-SNE or UMAP for the exploration and interpretation of large data sets due to their tree-like nature, increased local and global neighborhood and structure preservation, and the transparency of the methods the algorithm is based on. We apply TMAP to the most used chemistry data sets including databases of molecules such as ChEMBL, FDB17, the Natural Products Atlas, DSSTox, as well as to the MoleculeNet benchmark collection of data sets. We also show its broad applicability with further examples from biology, particle physics, and literature.},

  abstract = {We introduce De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNNs), a novel time-aware graph neural network architecture for time-resolved data on dynamic graphs. Our approach accounts for temporal-topological patterns that unfold in the causal topology of dynamic graphs, which is determined by causal walks, i.e. temporally ordered sequences of links by which nodes can influence each other over time. Our architecture builds on multiple layers of higher-order De Bruijn graphs, an iterative line graph construction where nodes in a De Bruijn graph of order k represent walks of length k-1, while edges represent walks of length k. We develop a graph neural network architecture that utilizes De Bruijn graphs to implement a message passing scheme that follows a non-Markovian dynamics, which enables us to learn patterns in the causal topology of a dynamic graph. Addressing the issue that De Bruijn graphs with different orders k can be used to model the same data set, we further apply statistical model selection to determine the optimal graph topology to be used for message passing. An evaluation in synthetic and empirical data sets suggests that DBGNNs can leverage temporal patterns in dynamic graphs, which substantially improves the performance in a supervised node classification task.},

  abstract = {Languages do not replace their vocabularies at an even rate: words endure longer if they are used more frequently. This effect, which has parallels in evolutionary biology, has been demonstrated for the core vocabulary, a set of common, unrelated meanings. The extent to which it replicates in closed lexical classes remains to be seen, and may indicate how general this effect is in language change. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the history of 10 kinship categories, a type of closed lexical class of content words, across 47 Indo-European languages. We find that their rate of replacement is correlated with their usage frequency, and this relationship is stronger than in the case of the core vocabulary, even though the envelope of variation is comparable across the two cases. We also find that the residual variation in the rate of replacement of kinship terms is related to genealogical distance of referent to kin. We argue that this relationship is the result of social changes and corresponding shifts in the entire semantic class of kinship terms, shifts typically not present in the core vocabulary. Thus, an understanding of the scope and limits of social change is needed to understand changes in kinship systems, and broader context is necessary to model cultural evolution in particular and the process of system change in general.},

A puzzling feature of Wikipedia however is its enormous size, at roughly seven times that of its commercial counterparts. What is driving this growth? And how can we assess the reliability of this giant encyclopedia arising solely from free-editing? We model contribution to Wikipedia and its reliability. We demonstrate that Wikipedia is indeed subject to free-riding, and offer a novel explanation for the mitigation of under-provision under such circumstances. We also find that the public-good feature of Wikipedia and free-riding introduce a lower-bound in the quality of Wikipedia. This finding is consistent with a previous empirical study that established Wikipedia{\quotedblbase}s surprisingly high level of quality. We identify Wikipedia as part of a general Internet phenomenon that we call the Collaborative Net, and that includes features such as citizen journalism and online reviews.},

We collect a large corpus of around 200,000 articles with their abstracts and the corresponding citation network that provides a first citation classification. Relevant keywords are extracted for each article through text-mining, allowing us to construct a semantic classification. We study the qualitative patterns of relations between endogenous disciplines within each classification, and finally show the complementarity of classifications and of their associated interdisciplinarity measures. The tools we develop accordingly are open and reusable for similar large scale studies of scientific environments. Our contribution therefore provides, besides the methodology, a new way to construct open databases and study journals for which data are difficult to obtain.},

Additionally, active inference has been proposed as the process theory entailed by FEP that is able to model the full range of biological and cognitive events. In this paper, we challenge these two claims. We argue that FEP is not the general principle it is claimed to be, and that active inference is not the all-encompassing process theory it is purported to be either. The core aspects of our argumentation are that (i) FEP is just a way to generalize Bayesian inference to all domains by the use of a Markov blanket formalism, a generalization we call the Markov blanket trick; and that (ii) active inference presupposes successful perception and action instead of explaining them.},

We developed an approach based on a mixture of Gaussian processes to identify clusters of patients sharing similar disease progression patterns, modeling their average trajectories and the variability in each cluster. We show that ALS progression is frequently nonlinear, with periods of stable disease preceded or followed by rapid decline. We also show that our approach can be extended to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Our results advance the characterization of disease progression of ALS and provide a flexible modeling approach that can be applied to other progressive diseases.},

The response to synchronization observed in some firefly species is illustrated utilizing a model based on electronic fireflies, and we explore the consequences of the firefly courtship as a whole process including the males' synchronization and the corresponding females' response. Some other aspects are pointed out, such as fireflies inspired models for communication networks, and the use of firefly synchronization concept in mobile networks and other devices. Finally, we explore the actual applications inspired in fireflies synchronicity and also the perspectives both in biomedical issues and in technological systems including robotics. This chapter attempts to reveal the most important aspects related to firefly synchronization providing an extensive bibliography which allows the reader to deepen in all the exciting and fascinating issues linked to the firefly behavior.},

This article proposes several criteria which isolate specific aspects of the performance of a method, such as its retrieval of inherent structure, its sensitivity to resampling and the stability of its results in the light of new data. These criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different clusterings of the same set of data; the measure essentially considers how each pair of data points is assigned in each clustering.},

  abstract = {The social and behavioral sciences have been increasingly using automated text analysis to measure psychological constructs in text. We explore whether GPT, the large-language model underlying the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, can be used as a tool for automated psychological text analysis in several languages. Across 15 datasets (n = 47,925 manually annotated tweets and news headlines), we tested whether different versions of GPT (3.5 Turbo, 4, and 4 Turbo) can accurately detect psychological constructs (sentiment, discrete emotions, offensiveness, and moral foundations) across 12 languages. We found that GPT (r = 0.59-0.77) performs much better than English-language dictionary analysis (r = 0.20-0.30) at detecting psychological constructs as judged by manual annotators. GPT performs nearly as well as, and sometimes better than, several top-performing fine-tuned machine learning models. Moreover, GPT's performance has improved across successive versions of the model, particularly for lesser-spoken languages. Overall, GPT may be superior to many existing methods of automated text analysis, since it achieves relatively high accuracy across many languages, requires no training data, and is easy to use with simple prompts (e.g., ``is this text negative?'') and little coding experience. We provide sample code and a video tutorial for analyzing text with the GPT application programming interface. We argue that GPT and other large-language models may democratize automated text analysis by making advanced natural language processing capabilities more accessible, and may help facilitate more cross-linguistic research with understudied languages.},

In the epistemology of science, the word               virtue               has referred to two different concepts. First, virtue can be understood as excellence, where excellence is a quality of a model, a theory, or a hypothesis. Second, virtue can be understood more narrowly as a stable character trait and/or disposition of scientists themselves. The first meaning is connected to the long-standing debate on the qualities that make a scientific theory a good scientific theory. The second meaning is connected to a much more recent conversation exploring the connections between virtue epistemology and philosophy of science. I explore how these two meanings of               virtue               have been developed, and I highlight underexplored areas that can advance our understanding of the relation between virtue theory and philosophy of science.},

Rawls substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and equal persons. "Each person," writes Rawls, "possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override." Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant, Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls's theory is as powerful today as it was when first published.},

When interpreted, Tarot images create a narrative that represents a process of individuation based on the integration of the unconscious into consciousness. The interpretation is based on a semiotic code constituting the ``language of signs'' structured in accord with Peirce's genuine triad. The therapeutic function of Tarot readings consists in the transformation of habits and discovering meanings in experience.The article presents Tarot typology in general, and specifically focuses on a documented case study for ``Marina,'' who consented to having her case discussed and published. The reading and interpretation of signs at the deep level of Marina's psyche brings many unconscious feelings to the level of conscious awareness. The new level of self-awareness empowers Marina with the ability to choose a novel course of action and achieve emotional security. Such a transformative effect would have been impossible in the absence of Tarot that provides an unorthodox epistemic access to the semiotic reality, thereby confirming Peirce's insight that all cognition is sign-mediated.},

Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,327 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core emotional arcs which form the essential building blocks of complex emotional trajectories. We strengthen our findings by separately applying matrix decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.

Within this framework, we implement several popular algorithms for topical inference, including Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in a way that makes them completely independent of the training corpus size. Particular emphasis is placed on straightforward and intuitive framework design, so that modifications and extensions of the methods and/or their application by interested practitioners are effortless.

  abstract = {Real kinds, both natural and social categories, are characterized by rich inductive potential. They have relatively stable sets of conceptually independent projectable properties. Somewhat surprisingly, even some purely social categories (e.g., ethnicity, gender, political orientation) show such multiple projectability. The article explores the origin of the inductive richness of social categories and concepts. I argue that existing philosophical accounts provide only a partial explanation, and mechanisms of boundary formation and stabilization must be brought into view for a more comprehensive account of inductively rich social categories.},

  abstract = {BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

  abstract = {Visualisations are supposed to provide intuitive ways to explore large document collections. State-of-the-art approaches usually transform high-dimensional representations of documents into 2-dimensional vectors using dimensionality reduction algorithms. These vectors are then placed into a landscape hopefully retaining semantic information regarding similarity from the high-dimensional representation. Traditionally, dimensionality reduction algorithms are developed with static collections in mind. However, many "real-world" document collections, such as news articles, scientific literature, patents, Wikipedia, or tweets, to name a few, grow and evolve over time. Visualising the temporal change of these collections poses various challenges for out-of-the-box dimensionality reduction algorithms. In this paper, we propose strategies to adapt existing dimensionality reduction algorithms to incorporate change. These strategies ensure that landscapes at different intervals of the collection are robust with regard to spatio-temporal coherence. Furthermore, we propose metrics to measure the stability over time and compare several popular dimensionality reduction algorithms.},

The resulting categorization schemes differ in substance. Research outcomes are typically assessed by using bibliometric methods, such as citation counts and patterns, or alternative metrics, such as references to research in the media. Shortcomings with these methods are their inability to identify impact of research beyond academia (bibliometrics) and considering text-based impact indicators beyond those that capture attention (altmetrics). We address these limitations by leveraging a mixed-methods approach for eliciting impact categories from experts, project personnel (deductive) and texts (inductive). Using these categories, we label a corpus of project reports per category schema, and apply supervised machine learning to infer these categories from project reports. The classification results show that we can predict deductively and inductively derived impact categories with 76.39\% and 78.81\% accuracy (F1-score), respectively. Our approach can complement solutions from bibliometrics and scientometrics for assessing the impact of research and studying the scope and types of advancements transferred from academia to society.},

Analyses of cross-lagged effects across two year intervals show similar effects of fluid intelligence on crystallized and vice versa (around {$\beta$}=.17). Parental socioeconomic status and parental education have in both samples a slightly stronger effect on crystallized than on fluid intelligence. The first result refutes Cattell's theory, the second gives some support.

  abstract = {Background               In recent years, interest has grown in whether and to what extent demographic diversity sparks discovery and innovation in research. At the same time, topic modeling has been employed to discover differences in what women and men write about. This study engages these two strands of scholarship to explore associations between changing researcher demographics and research questions asked in the discipline of history. Specifically, we analyze developments in history as women entered the field.                                         Methods               We focus on author gender in diachronic analysis of history dissertations from 1980 (when online data is first available) to 2015 and a select set of general history journals from 1950 to 2015. We use correlated topic modeling and network visualizations to map developments in research agendas over time and to examine how women and men have contributed to these developments.                                         Results               Our summary snapshot of aggregate interests of women and men for the period 1950 to 2015 identifies new topics associated with women authors: gender and women's history, body history, family and households, consumption and consumerism, and sexuality. Diachronic analysis demonstrates that while women pioneered topics such as gender and women's history or the history of sexuality, these topics broaden over time to become methodological frameworks that historians widely embraced and that changed in interesting ways as men engaged with them. Our analysis of history dissertations surface correlations between advisor/advisee gender pairings and choice of dissertation topic.                                         Conclusions               Overall, this quantitative longitudinal study suggests that the growth in women historians has coincided with the broadening of research agendas and an increased sensitivity to new topics and methodologies in the field.},

The possible ties among nodes of a network are regarded as random variables, and assumptions about dependencies among these random tie variables determine the general form of the exponential random graph model for the network. Examples of different dependence assumptions and their associated models are given, including Bernoulli, dyad-independent and Markov random graph models. The incorporation of actor attributes in social selection models is also reviewed. Newer, more complex dependence assumptions are briefly outlined. Estimation procedures are discussed, including new methods for Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We foreshadow the discussion taken up in other papers in this special edition: that the homogeneous Markov random graph models of Frank and Strauss [Frank, O., Strauss, D., 1986. Markov graphs. Journal of the American Statistical Association 81, 832--842] are not appropriate for many observed networks, whereas the new model specifications of Snijders et al.

  abstract = {Scholarly affinities are one of the most fundamental hidden dynamics that drive scientific development. Some affinities are actual, and consequently can be measured through classical academic metrics such as co-authoring. Other affinities are potential, and therefore do not leave visible traces in information systems; for instance, some peers may share interests without actually knowing it. This article illustrates the development of a map of affinities for academic collectives, designed to be relevant to three audiences: the management, the scholars themselves, and the external public. Our case study involves the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering of EPFL, hereinafter ENAC. The school consists of around 1,000 scholars, 70 laboratories, and 3 institutes. The actual affinities are modeled using the data available from the information systems reporting publications, teaching, and advising scholars, whereas the potential affinities are addressed through text mining of the publications. The major challenge for designing such a map is to represent the multi-dimensionality and multi-scale nature of the information. The affinities are not limited to the computation of heterogeneous sources of information; they also apply at different scales. The map, thus, shows local affinities inside a given laboratory, as well as global affinities among laboratories. This article presents a graphical grammar to represent affinities. Its effectiveness is illustrated by two actualizations of the design proposal: an interactive online system in which the map can be parameterized, and a large-scale carpet of 250 square meters. In both cases, we discuss how the materiality influences the representation of data, in particular the way key questions could be appropriately addressed considering the three target audiences: the insights gained by the management and their consequences in terms of governance, the understanding of the scholars' own positioning in the academic group in order to foster opportunities for new collaborations and, eventually, the interpretation of the structure from a general public to evaluate the relevance of the tool for external communication.},

This practice is prone to mistaking random patterns for real ones. Instead, we should reduce the number of hypothesis tests to only test meaningful ones. We address this problem by using theory to generate hypotheses for statistical models. We illustrate our approach with the example of the European Reformation, where we test a theory on the role of opinion leaders for the adoption of Protestantism with a logistic regression model. Given our specific setting, including choice of data and operationalisation of variables, we do not find enough evidence to claim that opinion leaders contributed via personal visits and letters to the adoption of Protestantism. To falsify or to support a theory, it has to be tested in different settings. Our presented approach helps the Digital Humanities bridge the gap between the qualitative and quantitative camp, advance understanding of structures resulting from human activity, and increase scientific credibility.},

  abstract = {Long-term slash-and-burn experiments, when compared with intensive tillage without manuring, resulted in a huge data set relating to potential crop yields, depending on soil quality, crop type, and agricultural measures. Cultivation without manuring or fallow phases did not produce satisfying yields, and mono-season cropping on freshly cleared and burned plots resulted in rather high yields, comparable to those produced during modern industrial agriculture - at least ten-fold the ones estimated for the medieval period. Continuous cultivation on the same plot, using imported wood from adjacent areas as fuel, causes decreasing yields over several years. The high yield of the first harvest of a slash-and-burn agriculture is caused by nutrient input through the ash produced and mobilization from the organic matter of the topsoil, due to high soil temperatures during the burning process and higher topsoil temperatures due to the soil's black surface. The harvested crops are pure, without contamination of any weeds. Considering the amount of work required to fight weeds without burning, the slash-and-burn technique yields much better results than any other tested agricultural approach. Therefore, in dense woodland, without optimal soils and climate, slash-and-burn agriculture seems to be the best, if not the only, feasible method to start agriculture, for example, during the Late Neolithic, when agriculture expanded from the loess belt into landscapes less suitable for agriculture. Extensive and cultivation with manuring is more practical in an already-open landscape and with a denser population, but its efficiency in terms of the ratio of the manpower input to food output, is worse. Slash-and-burn agriculture is not only a phenomenon of temperate European agriculture during the Neolithic, but played a major role in land-use in forested regions worldwide, creating anthromes on a huge spatial scale.},

Based on this review, a speculative peer-socialization model is presented that considers the implications of these sex differences for girls' and boys' emotional and behavioral development. Central to this model is the idea that sex-linked relationship processes have costs and benefits for girls' and boys' adjustment.

  abstract = {Species identification using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data strongly relies on reference libraries to differentiate species. Because comprehensive reference libraries, especially for metazoans, are rare, we explored the accuracy of unsupervised diversity estimations of communities using MALDI-TOF MS data in the absence of reference libraries to provide a method for future application in ecological research. To discover the best analysis strategy providing high congruence with true community structures, we carried out a simulation with more than 30,000 analyses using different combinations of data transformations, dimensionality reductions, and cluster algorithms. Species profile, Hellinger, and presence/absence transformations were applied to raw data and dimensions were reduced using principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and uniform manifold approximation and projection. To estimate biodiversity, data were clustered making use of partitioning around medoids, model-based clustering, and K-means clustering. The analyses were carried out on published mass spectrometry data of harpacticoid copepods. Most successful combinations (Hellinger transformation + PCA or raw data + partitioning around medoids) returned good values even for difficult species distributions containing numerous singleton species. Nevertheless, errors occurred most frequently because of such singleton taxa. Hence, replicative sampling in wide sampling areas for analysis is emphasized to increase the minimum number of specimens per species, thus reducing putative sources of errors. Our results demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS data can be used to accurately estimate the biodiversity of unknown communities using unsupervised learning methods. The provided approach allows the biodiversity comparison of sampled regions for which no reference libraries are available. Hence, especially data on groups which demand a time-consuming identification or are highly abundant can be analyzed within short working time, accelerating ecological studies.},

Above-average cited papers universally focus extensively on their own recent subfield -- as such, citation counts essentially select what may plausibly be considered as the most disciplinary and normal science; whereas papers which have a peculiar dynamics, such as re-birthing scientific works -- `rediscovered classics' or `early birds' -- are comparatively poorly cited, despite their plausible relevance for the underlying communities. The ``rebirth index'' that we propose to quantify this phenomenon may be used as a complementary quality-defining criterion, in addition to final citation counts.},

The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

When the different models can be shown to arise as different approximations to a unified theory, however, one might think the realist to be able to accommodate such cases. I discuss a special class of models (generated as non-uniform limits of a unified theory) and argue that a realist interpretation has to understand these models of a system as 'perspectival', in close analogy to different spatial perspectives onto the same object. For this sort of case, I also respond to Morrison's recent claim that in the process of unifying models into an overarching theory, explanatory and descriptive power are lost, leaving the unified theory with less of a claim to a realist interpretation than the models themselves.},

We build on existing models of Hebbian homeostasis, which have been shown to stabilize representations against synaptic turnover and allow discrete neuronal assemblies to track representational drift. We show that a downstream readout can use its own activity to detect and correct drift, and that such a self-healing code could be implemented by plausible synaptic rules. Population response normalization and recurrent dynamics could stabilize codes further. Our model reproduces aspects of drift observed in experiments, and posits neurally plausible mechanisms for long-term stable readouts from drifting population codes.},

  abstract = {There is now compelling evidence that the statistical distributions of extensive individual bibliometric indicators collected by a scholar, such as the number of publications or the total number of citations, are well represented by a Log-Normal function when homogeneous samples are considered. A Log-Normal distribution function is the normal distribution for the logarithm of the variable. In linear scale it is a highly skewed distribution with a long tail in the high productivity side. We are still lacking a detailed and convincing ab-initio model able to explain observed Log-Normal distributions---this is the gap this paper sets out to fill. Here, we propose a general explanation of the observed evidence by developing a straightforward model based on the following simple assumptions: (1) the materialist principle of the natural equality of human intelligence, (2) the success breeds success effect, also known as Merton effect, which can be traced back to the Gospel parables about the Talents (Matthew) and Minas (Luke), and, (3) the recognition and reputation mechanism. Building on these assumptions we propose a distribution function that, although mathematically not identical to a Log-Normal distribution, shares with it all its main features. Our model well reproduces the empirical distributions, so the hypotheses at the basis of the model are not falsified. Therefore the distributions of the bibliometric parameters observed might be the result of chance and noise (chaos) related to multiplicative phenomena connected to a publish or perish inflationary mechanism, led by scholars' recognition and reputations. In short, being a scholar in the right tail or in the left tail of the distribution could have very little connection to her/his merit and achievements. This interpretation might cast some doubts on the use of the number of papers and/or citations as a measure of scientific achievements. A tricky issue seems to emerge, that is: what then do bibliometric indicators really measure? This issue calls for deeper investigations into the meaning of bibliometric indicators. This is an interesting and intriguing topic for further research to be carried out within a wider interdisciplinary investigation of the science of science, which may include elements and investigation tools from philosophy, psychology and sociology.},

  pages = {29},
  abstract = {The need for fair and just AI is often related to the possibility of understanding AI itself, in other words, of turning an opaque box into a glass box, as inspectable as possible. Transparency and explainability, however, pertain to the technical domain and to philosophy of science, thus leaving the ethics and epistemology of AI largely disconnected. To remedy this, we propose an epistemology for glass box AI that explicitly considers how to incorporate values and other normative considerations at key stages of the whole process from design to implementation and use. To assess epistemological and ethical aspects of AI systems, we shift focus from trusting the output of such a system, to trusting the process that leads to such outcome. To do so, we build on `Computational Reliabilism' and on Creel's account of transparency. Further, we draw on argumentation theory, specifically about how to model the handling, eliciting, and interrogation of the authority and trustworthiness of expert opinion in order to elucidate how the design process of AI systems can be tested critically. By combining these insights, we develop a procedure for assessing the reliability and transparency of algorithmic decisionmaking that functions as a tool for experts and non-experts to inquiring into relevant epistemological and ethical aspects of AI systems. We then consider normative questions such as how social consequences that harm intersectionally vulnerable populations can be modelled in the context of AI design and implementation, drawing on work on the literature on inductive risk in the philosophy of science to think them through. Our epistemology-cum-ethics is developed from the vantage point of the conditions for enabling ethical assessment to be built into the whole process of design, implementation, and use of an AI system, in which values (epistemic and non-epistemic) are explicitly considered at each stage and by every salient actor involved. This approach, we think, complements other valuable accounts that target post-hoc ethical assessment.},

Yet, the origins of trust remain elusive, partly because social trust is difficult to document in time. Building on recent advances in social cognition, we design an algorithm to automatically generate trustworthiness evaluations for the facial action units (smile, eye brows, etc.) of European portraits in large historical databases. Our results show that trustworthiness in portraits increased over the period 1500--2000 paralleling the decline of interpersonal violence and the rise of democratic values observed in Western Europe. Further analyses suggest that this rise of trustworthiness displays is associated with increased living standards.},

  abstract = {We introduce Palette, a simple and general framework for image-to-image translation using conditional diffusion models. On four challenging image-to-image translation tasks (colorization, inpainting, uncropping, and JPEG decompression), Palette outperforms strong GAN and regression baselines, and establishes a new state of the art. This is accomplished without task-specific hyper-parameter tuning, architecture customization, or any auxiliary loss, demonstrating a desirable degree of generality and flexibility. We uncover the impact of using L2 vs. L1 loss in the denoising diffusion objective on sample diversity, and demonstrate the importance of self-attention through empirical architecture studies. Importantly, we advocate a unified evaluation protocol based on ImageNet, and report several sample quality scores including FID, Inception Score, Classification Accuracy of a pre-trained ResNet-50, and Perceptual Distance against reference images for various baselines. We expect this standardized evaluation protocol to play a critical role in advancing image-to-image translation research. Finally, we show that a single generalist Palette model trained on 3 tasks (colorization, inpainting, JPEG decompression) performs as well or better than task-specific specialist counterparts.

We apply these methods to diverse datasets from over 20 species, including humans, bats, songbirds, mice, cetaceans, and nonhuman primates, enabling high-powered comparative analyses of unbiased acoustic features in the communicative repertoires across species. Latent projections uncover complex features of data in visually intuitive and quantifiable ways. We introduce methods for analyzing vocalizations as both discrete sequences and as continuous latent variables. Each method can be used to disentangle complex spectro-temporal structure and observe long-timescale organization in communication. Finally, we show how systematic sampling from latent representational spaces of vocalizations enables comprehensive investigations of perceptual and neural representations of complex and ecologically relevant acoustic feature spaces.},

Conversely, the sequential structure of nonhuman communication is thought to follow non-hierarchical Markovian dynamics operating over only short distances. Here, we show that human speech and birdsong share a similar sequential structure indicative of both hierarchical and Markovian organization. We analyze the sequential dynamics of song from multiple songbird species and speech from multiple languages by modeling the information content of signals as a function of the sequential distance between vocal elements. Across short sequence-distances, an exponential decay dominates the information in speech and birdsong, consistent with underlying Markovian processes. At longer sequence-distances, the decay in information follows a power law, consistent with underlying hierarchical processes. Thus, the sequential organization of acoustic elements in two learned vocal communication signals (speech and birdsong) shows functionally equivalent dynamics, governed by similar processes.},

This paper implements the `model approach' to investigate the erosion of the traditional art-nature distinction in early modern natural philosophy. I argue that a condition for this transformation has to be located in the late scholastic conception of final causation. I design a conceptual model to capture the art-nature distinction and formulate a working hypothesis about its early modern fate. I test my hypothesis on a selected corpus of 25 works published in the Dutch academic milieu between 1607 and 1748. I analyse the corpus through a procedure based on concordancing of keywords associated with the model. I argue that the results obtained constitute a successful pilot study for the implementation of the model approach on larger scale research.},

Several such services exist that provide access to large databases of names, often enriched with information from social media profiles, culture-specific rules, and insights from sociolinguistics. We compare and benchmark five name-to-gender inference services by applying them to the classification of a test data set consisting of 7,076 manually labeled names. The compiled names are analyzed and characterized according to their geographical and cultural origin. We define a series of performance metrics to quantify various types of classification errors, and define a parameter tuning procedure to search for optimal values of the services' free parameters. Finally, we perform benchmarks of all services under study regarding several scenarios where a particular metric is to be optimized.},

Despite a plethora of methods having been proposed for the analysis of multivariate time series, most of them do not investigate whether signals result from independent, pairwise, or group interactions. Here, we propose a novel framework to characterize the temporal evolution of higher-order dependencies within multivariate time series. Using network analysis and topology, we show that, unlike traditional tools, our framework robustly differentiates various spatiotemporal regimes of coupled chaotic maps, including chaotic dynamical phases and various types of synchronization. By analysing fMRI signals, we find that, during rest, the human brain mainly oscillates between chaotic and few partially intermittent states, with higher-order structures reflecting sensorimotor areas. Similarly, in financial and epidemic time series, instead, higher-order information efficiently discriminates between radically different coordination and spreading regimes. Overall, our approach sheds new light on the higher-order organization of multivariate time series, allowing for a better characterization of dynamical group dependencies inherent to real-world systems.},

To address some of these practical challenges, we develop a framework of generalized dynamic cognitive hierarchy for both modelling naturalistic human driving behavior as well as behavior planning for autonomous vehicles (AV). This framework is built upon a rich model of level-0 behavior through the use of automata strategies, an interpretable notion of bounded rationality through safety and maneuver satisficing, and a robust response for planning. Based on evaluation on two large naturalistic datasets as well as simulation of critical traffic scenarios, we show that i) automata strategies are well suited for level-0 behavior in a dynamic level-k framework, and ii) the proposed robust response to a heterogeneous population of strategic and non-strategic reasoners can be an effective approach for game theoretic planning in AV.},

The epistemic aims of philosophy, if there are any, are frustrated by engaging with the history of philosophy, because we have little reason to think that the claims made by history's great philosophers would survive closer scrutiny today. First, I review the case for philosophical historiography and show how it falls short. I then present several arguments for skepticism about the philosophical value of engaging with the history of philosophy and offer an explanation for why philosophical historiography would seem to make sense even if it didn't.},

The model computes a low-dimensional embedding that aims to preserve neighborhood relationships encoded by a sparse graph. The model both leverages and extends current leading approaches to this problem. Like t-distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding, the model can produce two- and three-dimensional embeddings for visualization, but it can also learn higher-dimensional embeddings for other uses. Like LargeVis and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, the model produces embeddings by balancing two goals---pulling nearby examples closer together and pushing distant examples further apart. Unlike these approaches, however, the latent variables in our model provide additional structure that can be exploited for learning. We derive an Expectation--Maximization procedure with closed-form updates that monotonically improve the model's likelihood: In this procedure, embeddings are iteratively adapted by solving sparse, diagonally dominant systems of linear equations that arise from a discrete graph Laplacian. For large problems, we also develop an approximate coarse-graining procedure that avoids the need for negative sampling of nonadjacent nodes in the graph. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on datasets of images and text.},

  abstract = {The current rate of production and consumption of meat poses a problem both to peoples\&rsquo; health and to the environment. This work aims to develop a simulation of peoples\&rsquo; meat consumption in Britain using agent-based modelling. The agents represent individual consumers. The key variables that characterise agents include sex, age, monthly income, perception of the living cost, and concerns about the impact of meat on the environment, health, and animal welfare. A process of peer influence is modelled with respect to the agents\&rsquo; concerns. Influence spreads across two eating networks (i.e. co-workers and household members) depending on the time of day, day of the week, and agents\&rsquo; employment status. Data from a representative sample of British consumers is used to empirically ground the model. Different experiments are run simulating interventions of the application of social marketing campaigns and a rise in price of meat. The main outcome is the mean weekly consumption of meat per consumer. A secondary outcome is the likelihood of eating meat. Analyses are run on the overall artificial population and by subgroups. The model succeeded in reproducing observed consumption patterns. Different sizes of effect on consumption emerged depending on the application of a social marketing strategy or a price increase. A price increase had a greater effect than environmental and animal welfare campaigns, while a health campaign had a larger impact on consumers\&rsquo; behaviour than the other campaigns. An environmental campaign targeted at consumers concerned about the environment produced a boomerang effect increasing the consumption in the population rather than reducing it. The results of the simulation experiments are mainly consistent with the literature on food consumption providing support for future models of public strategies to reduce meat consumption.},

Maintenance and repair technologies have been a vital aspect of relations between makers and other users. Their history illuminates systems of instruction, support, and abuse. These systems were, for example, evident in the development of astronomical instruments around 1800 within and beyond the European sphere. Episodes from that milieu are used to explore how instrument users sought autonomy, how instruments' mutable character was defined, and how judgments of instruments' failure or success were ever secured.},

On this basis, we describe some of the ways in which computational models from other disciplines have found their way into philosophy, and how the principles one found here still underlie current trends in the field. Moreover, we argue that philosophers contribute to computational modeling not only by building their own models, but also by thinking about the various applications of the method in philosophy and the sciences. In this context, we note that models in philosophy are usually simple, while models in the sciences are often more complex and empirically grounded. Bridging certain methodological gaps that arise from this discrepancy may prove to be challenging and fruitful for the further development of computational modeling in philosophy and beyond.},

  abstract = {A macroscopic view of cultural history Sociologists and anthropologists study the growth and evolution of human culture, but it is hard to measure cultural interactions on a historical time scale. Schich et al. developed a tool for extracting information about cultural history from simple but large sets of birth and death records. A network of cultural centers connected via the birth and death of more than 150,000 notable individuals revealed human mobility patterns and cultural attraction dynamics. Patterns of city growth over a period of 2000 years differed between countries, but the distribution of birth-to-death distances remained unchanged over more than eight centuries. Science, this issue p. 558 The emergent processes driving cultural history are a product of complex interactions among large numbers of individuals, determined by difficult-to-quantify historical conditions. To characterize these processes, we have reconstructed aggregate intellectual mobility over two millennia through the birth and death locations of more than 150,000 notable individuals. The tools of network and complexity theory were then used to identify characteristic statistical patterns and determine the cultural and historical relevance of deviations. The resulting network of locations provides a macroscopic perspective of cultural history, which helps us to retrace cultural narratives of Europe and North America using large-scale visualization and quantitative dynamical tools and to derive historical trends of cultural centers beyond the scope of specific events or narrow time intervals. Birth and death records of notable individuals reveal a picture of Western cultural history over two millennia.

  abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to develop a consolidated helicopter parenting scale (CHPS) from five existing measures of helicopter parenting and utilize the new measure to examine the relationship between helicopter parenting and intelligence mindset. Methods Participants were 275 emerging adults between 18--25 years of age who completed an online survey. First, we conducted an Exploratory Factor Analysis of five helicopter parenting measures to develop a scale that reliably measured participants' reports of helicopter parenting by both their mothers and fathers. Then, we utilized the new measure to examine whether helicopter parenting mediated the relationship between emerging adults' report of their parents' failure mindsets and their own intelligence mindsets. Results The 10 items retained in the factor analysis primarily captured emerging adults' perception that their parents' involvement was inappropriate rather than delineating objective behaviors in which their parents engaged. Both mothers and fathers were more likely to engage in helicopter parenting when emerging adults reported their parents had a failure mindset. However, only fathers' helicopter parenting mediated the relationship between parents' failure mindsets and their children's intelligence mindsets. Conclusions When parents were viewed as having a failure-is-debilitating mindset, emerging adults also reported that fathers were more likely to participate in helicopter parenting behaviors, which was associated with fixed mindsets in emerging adults. People with fixed mindsets have been found to have decreased motivation (e.g., avoiding challenges and less perseverance) and academic achievement in prior research.},

However, software is usually not formally cited, but rather mentioned informally within the scholarly description of the investigation, raising the need for automatic information extraction and disambiguation. Given the lack of reliable ground truth data, we present SoMeSci (Software Mentions in Science) a gold standard knowledge graph of software mentions in scientific articles. It contains high quality annotations (IRR: \${\textbackslash}kappa\{=\}.82\$) of 3756 software mentions in 1367 PubMed Central articles. Besides the plain mention of the software, we also provide relation labels for additional information, such as the version, the developer, a URL or citations. Moreover, we distinguish between different types, such as application, plugin or programming environment, as well as different types of mentions, such as usage or creation. To the best of our knowledge, SoMeSci is the most comprehensive corpus about software mentions in scientific articles, providing training samples for Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Entity Disambiguation, and Entity Linking. Finally, we sketch potential use cases and provide baseline results.},

However, this paradigm has not yet taken hold in deep reinforcement learning (RL). This gap is due to the fact that the most abundant form of embodied behavioral data on the web consists of videos, which do not include the action labels required by existing methods for training policies from offline data. We introduce Latent Action Policies from Observation (LAPO), a method to infer latent actions and, consequently, latent-action policies purely from action-free demonstrations. Our experiments on challenging procedurally-generated environments show that LAPO can act as an effective pre-training method to obtain RL policies that can then be rapidly fine-tuned to expert-level performance. Our approach serves as a key stepping stone to enabling the pre-training of powerful, generalist RL models on the vast amounts of action-free demonstrations readily available on the web.},

However, whether such an option exists cannot be known unless an alleged dilemma is properly tested. To conduct such a test, Altshuller's Algorithm for Solving Inventive Problems (ARIZ-85C), a method for finding creative solutions to dilemmatic problems, is being applied to the famous trolley dilemma. The trolley dilemma is a moral dilemma where people must choose between killing one person or five people by a runaway trolley. The paper shows that the trolley dilemma is a false dilemma that can be solved without any deaths by using the steps defined by ARIZ-85C. It also reports the results of a survey that tested the perceived morality of this solution compared to the standard options. The overwhelming majority of survey respondents opted for the third option. Overall, the paper argues that the sequence of steps of ARIZ-85C can be used as a tool to expose and solve false dilemmas in various domains.},

To address these questions, Schwitzgebel and Rust empirically investigated if philosophy professors engaged with ethics on a professional basis behave any morally better or, at least, more consistently with their expressed values than do non-ethicist professors. Findings from their original US-based sample indicated that neither is the case, suggesting that there is no positive influence of ethical reflection on moral action. In the study at hand, we attempted to cross-validate this pattern of results in the German-speaking countries and surveyed 417 professors using a replication-extension research design. Our results indicate a successful replication of the original effect that ethicists do not behave any morally better compared to other academics across the vast majority of normative issues. Yet, unlike the original study, we found mixed results on normative attitudes generally. On some issues, ethicists and philosophers even expressed more lenient attitudes. However, one issue on which ethicists not only held stronger normative attitudes but also reported better corresponding moral behaviors was vegetarianism.},

For state formation to be incentive compatible, subjects must not evade the state through migration. This paper shows that state formation occurs in places that are agriculturally productive but circumscribed by low productivity land, making evasion through migration more costly. This result is borne out in (a) regressions across 176,512 land cells, (b) comparing archaeological sites related to state formation to other sites, and (c) comparing only river valleys to one another. The timing of state formation is also strongly related to the intensity of environmental circumscription. Circumscription is particularly predictive of state formation in global migratory bottlenecks, and ancient cities emerge only after state formation.},

A short account of the historical development of this holistic form of group therapy, which integrates the client's self-perception of his/her body and feelings as an essential element into the therapeutic process, will be followed by illustrating the theoretical background and practical applications of the approach. Pesso's comprehensive theoretical system is unique both from the pointof-view of developmental psychology and aetiology of disorders.

  abstract = {Although machine learning has been successful in recent years and is increasingly being deployed in the sciences, enterprises or administrations, it has rarely been discussed in philosophy beyond the philosophy of mathematics and machine learning. The present contribution addresses the resulting lack of conceptual tools for an epistemological discussion of machine learning by conceiving of deep learning networks as `judging machines' and using the Kantian analysis of judgments for specifying the type of judgment they are capable of. At the center of the argument is the fact that the functionality of deep learning networks is established by training and cannot be explained and justified by reference to a predefined rule-based procedure. Instead, the computational process of a deep learning network is barely explainable and needs further justification, as is shown in reference to the current research literature. Thus, it requires a new form of justification, that is to be specified with the help of Kant's epistemology.},

  abstract = {Mathematical expressions can be represented as a tree consisting of terminal symbols, such as identifiers or numbers (leaf nodes), and functions or operators (non-leaf nodes). Expression trees are an important mechanism for storing and processing mathematical expressions as well as the most frequently used visualization of the structure of mathematical expressions. Typically, researchers and practitioners manually visualize expression trees using general-purpose tools. This approach is laborious, redundant, and error-prone. Manual visualizations represents a user's notion of what the markup of an expression should be, but not necessarily what the actual markup is. This paper presents VMEXT -- a free and open source tool to directly visualize expression trees from parallel Open image in new window . VMEXT simultaneously visualizes the presentation elements and the semantic structure of mathematical expressions to enable users to quickly spot deficiencies in the Content Open image in new window markup that does not affect the presentation of the expression. Identifying such discrepancies previously required reading the verbose and complex Open image in new window markup. VMEXT also allows one to visualize similar and identical elements of two expressions. Visualizing expression similarity can support developers in designing retrieval approaches and enable improved interaction concepts for users of mathematical information retrieval systems. We demonstrate VMEXT's visualizations in two web-based applications. The first application presents the visualizations alone. The second application shows a possible integration of the visualizations in systems for mathematical knowledge management and mathematical information retrieval. The application converts Open image in new window input to parallel Open image in new window , computes basic similarity measures for mathematical expressions, and visualizes the results using VMEXT.},

  abstract = {In three recent papers, Wayne Myrvold (1996, 2003) and Timothy McGrew (2003) have developed Bayesian accounts of the virtue of unification. In his account, McGrew demonstrates that, ceteris paribus, a hypothesis that unifies its evidence will have a higher posterior probability than a hypothesis that does not. Myrvold, on the other hand, offers a specific measure of unification that can be applied to individual hypotheses. He argues that one must account for this measure in order to calculate correctly the degree of confirmation that a hypothesis receives from its evidence. Using the probability calculus, I prove that the two accounts of unification require the same underlying inequality; thus, McGrew and Myrvold have accounted for unification in fundamentally identical probabilistic terms. I then evaluate five putative counterexamples to this account and show that these examples, far from disqualifying it, serve to clarify our notion of unification by disentangling it from a host of other concepts.},

This paper proposes a ``dialectical solution'' to this conflict, by arguing that causal explanations are preferable to non-causal ones, because they lead to a higher degree of unification at the level of explaining statistical regularities. The core axioms of the theory of causal nets (TC) are justified because they offer the best if not the only unifying explanation of two statistical phenomena: screening off and linking up. Alternative explanations of the two phenomena are discussed and it is shown why they don't work. It is demonstrated that although the core axioms of TC are empirically vacuous, extended versions of TC have empirical content by means of which they can generate independently testable predictions.},

A classification of different patterns of abduction is provided which intends to be as complete as possible (Sect. 2). An important distinction is that between selective abductions, which choose an optimal candidate from given multitude of possible explanations (Sects. 3-4), and creative abductions, which introduce new theoretical models or concepts (Sects. 5-7). While selective abduction has dominated the literature, creative abductions are rarely discussed, although they are essential in science. The article introduces several kinds of creative abductions, such as theoretical model abduction, common cause abduction and statistical factor analysis, and illustrates them by various real case examples. It is suggested to demarcate scientifically fruitful abductions from purely speculative abductions by the criterion of causal unification (Sect. 7.1).},

Both determine their emotional expression, from which collective emotional information is generated.

In contrast, philosophy articles published in elite Chinese-language and Spanish-language journals cite from a range of linguistic traditions, as do non-English-language articles in a convenience sample of established European-language journals. We also find evidence that work in English has more influence on work in other languages than vice versa and that when non-Anglophone philosophers cite recent work outside of their own linguistic tradition it tends to be work in English.},

Why did humans abandon hunting and gathering for sedentary communities dependent on livestock and cereal grains, and governed by precursors of today's states? Most people believe that plant and animal domestication allowed humans, finally, to settle down and form agricultural villages, towns, and states, which made possible civilization, law, public order, and a presumably secure way of living. But archaeological and historical evidence challenges this narrative. The first agrarian states, says James C. Scott, were born of accumulations of domestications: first fire, then plants, livestock, subjects of the state, captives, and finally women in the patriarchal family-all of which can be viewed as a way of gaining control over reproduction. Scott explores why we avoided sedentism and plow agriculture, the advantages of mobile subsistence, the unforeseeable disease epidemics arising from crowding plants, animals, and grain, and why all early states are based on millets and cereal grains and unfree labor. He also discusses the "barbarians" who long evaded state control, as a way of understanding continuing tension between states and nonsubject peoples},

  abstract = {What big questions and large-scale narratives give coherence to the history of science? From the late 1970s onward, the field has been transformed through a stress on practice and fresh perspectives from gender studies, the sociology of knowledge, and work on a greatly expanded range of practitioners and cultures. Yet these developments, although long overdue and clearly beneficial, have been accompanied by fragmentation and loss of direction. This essay suggests that the narrative frameworks used by historians of science need to come to terms with diversity by understanding science as a form of communication. The centrality of processes of movement, translation, and transmission is already emerging in studies of topics ranging from ethnographic encounters to the history of reading. Not only does this approach offer opportunities for crossing boundaries of nation, period, and discipline that are all too easily taken for granted; it also has the potential for creating a more effective dialogue with other historians and the wider public.},

  abstract = {We provide two contributions, a taxonomy of visual cluster separation factors in scatterplots, and an in-depth qualitative evaluation of two recently proposed and validated separation measures. We initially intended to use these measures to provide guidance for the use of dimension reduction (DR) techniques and visual encoding (VE) choices, but found that they failed to produce reliable results. To understand why, we conducted a systematic qualitative data study covering a broad collection of 75 real and synthetic high-dimensional datasets, four DR techniques, and three scatterplot-based visual encodings. Two authors visually inspected over 800 plots to determine whether or not the measures created plausible results. We found that they failed in over half the cases overall, and in over two-thirds of the cases involving real datasets. Using open and axial coding of failure reasons and separability characteristics, we generated a taxonomy of visual cluster separability factors. We iteratively refined its explanatory clarity and power by mapping the studied datasets and success and failure ranges of the measures onto the factor axes. Our taxonomy has four categories, ordered by their ability to influence successors: Scale, Point Distance, Shape, and Position. Each category is split into Within-Cluster factors such as density, curvature, isotropy, and clumpiness, and Between-Cluster factors that arise from the variance of these properties, culminating in the overarching factor of class separation. The resulting taxonomy can be used to guide the design and the evaluation of cluster separation measures.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised dimensionality reduction (DR) aims to preserve input data structure in a low-dimensional (LD) space based on neighborhood information. In contrast, supervised DR intends to improve the learning performance, i.e., classification and regression, in an LD representation. Unfortunately, obtaining the complete label outputs of a data set for real-world applications is hard. Here, we introduce a novel DR framework coupling both available class labels and input feature similarities to extend the well-known t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) for semi-supervised scenarios. Our proposal, termed Semi-Supervised t-SNE (SS.t-SNE), properly fixes the widths of Gaussian neighborhoods to reveal the salient local and global data structures in an LD space. Indeed, our approach is presented as a generalization of unsupervised and supervised versions of t-SNE. SS.t-SNE outperforms other semi-supervised DR methods in data visualization and classification tasks in LD embeddings.},

This difference in citation does not change after the publication of the failure to replicate. Only 12\% of postreplication citations of nonreplicable findings acknowledge the replication failure. Existing evidence also shows that experts predict well which papers will be replicated. Given this prediction, why are nonreplicable papers accepted for publication in the first place? A possible answer is that the review team faces a trade-off. When the results are more ``interesting,'' they apply lower standards regarding their reproducibility. Published papers that fail to replicate are cited more than those that replicate, even after the failure is published.

  abstract = {Societies are complex. Properties of social systems can be explained by the interplay and weaving of individual actions. Rewards are key to understand people's choices and decisions. For instance, individual preferences of where to live may lead to the emergence of social segregation. In this paper, we combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Agent Based Modeling (ABM) in order to address the self-organizing dynamics of social segregation and explore the space of possibilities that emerge from considering different types of rewards. Our model promotes the creation of interdependencies and interactions among multiple agents of two different kinds that segregate from each other. For this purpose, agents use Deep Q-Networks to make decisions inspired on the rules of the Schelling Segregation model and rewards for interactions. Despite the segregation reward, our experiments show that spatial integration can be achieved by establishing interdependencies among agents of different kinds. They also reveal that segregated areas are more probable to host older people than diverse areas, which attract younger ones. Through this work, we show that the combination of RL and ABM can create an artificial environment for policy makers to observe potential and existing behaviors associated to rules of interactions and rewards.},

  abstract = {Is there a single principle by which neural operations can account for perception, cognition, action, and even consciousness? A strong candidate is now taking shape in the form of ``predictive processing''. On this theory, brains engage in predictive inference on the causes of sensory inputs by continuous minimization of prediction errors or informational ``free energy''. Predictive processing can account, supposedly, not only for perception, but also for action and for the essential contribution of the body and environment in structuring sensorimotor interactions. In this paper I draw together some recent developments within predictive processing that involve predictive modelling of internal physiological states (interoceptive inference), and integration with ``enactive'' and ``embodied'' approaches to cognitive science (predictive perception of sensorimotor contingencies). The upshot is a development of predictive processing that originates, not in Helmholtzian perception-as-inference, but rather in 20th-century cybernetic principles that emphasized homeostasis and predictive control. This way of thinking leads to (i) a new view of emotion as active interoceptive inference; (ii) a common predictive framework linking experiences of body ownership, emotion, and exteroceptive perception; (iii) distinct interpretations of active inference as involving disruptive and disambiguatory---not just confirmatory---actions to test perceptual hypotheses; (iv) a neurocognitive operationalization of the ``mastery of sensorimotor contingencies'' (where sensorimotor contingencies reflect the rules governing sensory changes produced by various actions); and (v) an account of the sense of subjective reality of perceptual contents (``perceptual presence'') in terms of the extent to which predictive models encode potential sensorimotor relations (this being ``counterfactual richness''). This is rich and varied territory, and surveying its landmarks emphasizes the need for experimental tests of its key contributions.},

  abstract = {Reader reviews of literary fiction on social media, especially those in persistent, dedicated forums, create and are in turn driven by underlying narrative frameworks. In their comments about a novel, readers generally include only a subset of characters and their relationships, thus offering a limited perspective on that work. Yet in aggregate, these reviews capture an underlying narrative framework comprised of different actants (people, places, things), their roles, and interactions that we label the "consensus narrative framework". We represent this framework in the form of an actant-relationship story graph. Extracting this graph is a challenging computational problem, which we pose as a latent graphical model estimation problem. Posts and reviews are viewed as samples of sub graphs/networks of the hidden narrative framework. Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a graphical generative Machine Learning (ML) model where nodes represent actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific relationships. We develop a pipeline of interlocking automated methods to extract key actants and their relationships, and apply it to thousands of reviews and comments posted on Goodreads.com. We manually derive the ground truth narrative framework from SparkNotes, and then use word embedding tools to compare relationships in ground truth networks with our extracted networks. We find that our automated methodology generates highly accurate consensus narrative frameworks: for our four target novels, with approximately 2900 reviews per novel, we report average coverage/recall of important relationships of {$>$} 80\% and an average edge detection rate of {$>$}89{\textbackslash}\%. These extracted narrative frameworks can generate insight into how people (or classes of people) read and how they recount what they have read to others.},

While traditional sociology of knowledge asked how, and to what extent, "social factors" might influence the products of the mind, SSK sought to show that knowledge was constitutively social, and in so doing, it raised fundamental questions about taken-for-granted divisions between "social versus cognitive, or natural, factors." This piece traces the historical development of the sociology of scientific knowledge and its relations with sociology and cultural inquiry as a whole. It identifies dominant "localist" sensibilities in SSK and the consequent problem it now confronts of how scientific knowledge travels. Finally, it describes several strands of criticism of SSK that have emerged from among its own practitioners, noting the ways in which some criticisms can be seen as a revival of old aspirations toward privileged meta-languages.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method that is known for being simple and easy to interpret. Principal components are often interpreted as low-dimensional patterns in high-dimensional space. However, this simple interpretation fails for timeseries, spatial maps, and other continuous data. In these cases, nonoscillatory data may have oscillatory principal components. Here, we show that two common properties of data cause oscillatory principal components: smoothness and shifts in time or space. These two properties implicate almost all neuroscience data. We show how the oscillations produced by PCA, which we call ``phantom oscillations,'' impact data analysis. We also show that traditional cross-validation does not detect phantom oscillations, so we suggest procedures that do. Our findings are supported by a collection of mathematical proofs. Collectively, our work demonstrates that patterns which emerge from high-dimensional data analysis may not faithfully represent the underlying data.},

This review introduces some of the basic principles of complex systems science, including complexity profiles, the tradeoff between efficiency and adaptability, the necessity of matching the complexity of systems to that of their environments, multi-scale analysis, and evolutionary processes. Our focus is on the general properties of systems as opposed to the modeling of specific dynamics; rather than provide a comprehensive review, we pedagogically describe a conceptual and analytic approach for understanding and interacting with the complex systems of our world. With the exception of a few footnotes, this paper assumes only a high school mathematical and scientific background, so that it may be accessible to academics in all fields, decision-makers in industry, government, and philanthropy, and anyone who is interested in systems and society.},

There is one substantial historical thesis proposed, and facts are adduced from the chronology to back it up: that the divide was never absolute, never purely geographical, and above all that it was not inevitable, but was largely the product of accidental historical circumstances, of which the most crucial was the ourishing of totalitarianism in Europe and the disruption caused by two world wars.},

Although his idea was initially discredited in the sociology of science, subsequent research indicates that the conjecture has considerable empirical merit. Significantly, that research inserts psychology between biology and sociology, with significantly more proximity with biology. After replicating the earlier findings using new measures, the metatheoretical basis for the hierarchical arrangement is then examined.

People with profound mental retardation pose a problem for this set of beliefs, because their cognitive capacities are not superior to those of many animals. I argue that we should drop the belief in the equal value of human life, replacing it with a graduated view that applies to animals as well as to humans.},

We explore the interdependence between evolving citation and co-authorship networks focused on the publications, by Indian authors, in American Physical Society journals between 1970 and 2013. We record interactions between each possible pair of authors in two ways: first, by tracing the change in citations, they exchanged and, second, by tracing the shortest path between authors in the co-authorship network. We create these data for every year of the period of our analysis. We use probability methods to quantify the correlation between citations and shortest paths, and the effect on the dynamics of the citation-co-authorship system. We find that author pairs who have a co-authorship distance \$\$d {\textbackslash}le 3\$\$d{$\leq$}3significantly affect each other's citations, but that this effect falls off rapidly for longer distances in the co-authorship network. The exchange of citation between pairs with \$\$d=1\$\$d=1exhibits a sudden increase at the time of first co-authorship events and decays thereafter, indicating an ageing effect in collaboration. This behaviour suggests that the dynamics of the co-authorship network appear to be driving those of the citation network rather than vice versa. Moreover, the majority of citations received by most authors are due to reciprocal citations from current, or past, co-authors. We conclude that, in order to answer questions on the nature and dynamics of scientific collaboration, it is necessary to study both co-authorship and citation network simultaneously.},

It includes 24 challenging and realistic tasks, 8 of which are new, across four formats: classification, regression, ranking and search. We then use this benchmark to study and improve the generalization ability of scientific document representation models. We show how state-of-the-art models like SPECTER and SciNCL struggle to generalize across the task formats, and that simple multi-task training fails to improve them. However, a new approach that learns multiple embeddings per document, each tailored to a different format, can improve performance. We experiment with task-format-specific control codes and adapters and find they outperform the existing single-embedding state-of-the-art by over 2 points absolute. We release the resulting family of multi-format models, called SPECTER2, for the community to use and build on.},

Readers may detect an irony in the relationship between our method and case study. No academic discipline has valorized the use of quantification for social analysis more than economics. As a discipline, its language has become saturated with the language of modeling. Cultural and literary critics have long argued that economics has even harmed society by creating false accounts of how humans behave and think.

The level addressed is the level of research topics. The methodology we propose uses synthesis papers and their reference articles to construct a baseline classification. A dataset of about 31 million publications, and their mutual citations relations, is used to obtain several ACPLCs of different granularity. Each ACPLC is compared to the baseline classification and the best performing ACPLC is identified. The results of two case studies show that the topics of the cases are closely associated with different classes of the identified ACPLC, and that these classes tend to treat only one topic. Further, the class size variation is moderate, and only a small proportion of the publications belong to very small classes. For these reasons, we conclude that the proposed methodology is suitable to determine the topic granularity level of an ACPLC and that the ACPLC identified by this methodology is useful for bibliometric analyses.},

However, existing text-based methods face challenges in producing valid and reliable time-series data. This article proposes a scaling algorithm called WORDFISH to estimate policy positions based on word frequencies in texts. The technique allows researchers to locate parties in one or multiple elections. We demonstrate the algorithm by estimating the positions of German political parties from 1990 to 2005 using word frequencies in party manifestos. The extracted positions reflect changes in the party system more accurately than existing time-series estimates. In addition, the method allows researchers to examine which words are important for placing parties on the left and on the right. We find that words with strong political connotations are the best discriminators between parties. Finally, a series of robustness checks demonstrate that the estimated positions are insensitive to distributional assumptions and document selection.}

What factors allow good methodological advances to spread across disciplines? In this paper, we investigate some key features determining the success and failure of methodological spread between the sciences. We introduce a formal model that considers factors like methodological competence and reviewer bias toward one's own methods. We show how these self-preferential biases can protect poor methodology within scientific communities, and lack of reviewer competence can contribute to failures to adopt better methods. We then use a second model to argue that input from outside disciplines can help break down barriers to methodological improvement. In doing so, we illustrate an underappreciated benefit of interdisciplinarity.},

  abstract = {Humans regularly solve complex problems in cooperative teams. A wide range of mechanisms have been identified that improve the quality of solutions achieved by those teams upon reaching consensus. We argue that many of these mechanisms work via increasing the transient diversity of solutions while the group attempts to reach a consensus. These mechanisms can operate at the level of individual psychology (e.g., behavioral inertia), interpersonal communication (e.g., transmission noise), or group structure (e.g., sparse social networks).  Transient diversity can be increased by widening the search space of possible solutions or by slowing the diffusion of information and delaying consensus. All of these mechanisms increase the quality of the solution at the cost of increased time to reach it. We review specific mechanisms that facilitate transient diversity and synthesize evidence from both empirical studies and diverse formal models---including multi-armed bandits, NK landscapes, cumulative innovation models, and evolutionary transmission models. Apparent exceptions to this principle occur primarily when problems are sufficiently simple that they can be solved by mere trial and error, or when the incentives of team members are insufficiently aligned. This work has implications for our understanding of collective intelligence, problem solving, innovation, and cumulative cultural evolution.},

We present a novel approach to identifying emerging topics in science and technology. Two large scale models of the scientific literature, one based on direct citation, and the other based on co-citation, are combined to nominate emerging topics using a difference function that rewards clusters that are new and growing rapidly. The top 25 emergent topics are identified for each year 2007 through 2010. These topics are classified and characterized in various ways in order to understand the motive forces behind their emergence, whether scientific discovery, technological innovation, or exogenous events. Topics are evaluated by searching for recent major awards associated with the topic or its key researchers. The evidence presented suggests that the methodology nominates a viable list of emerging topics suitable for inspection by decision makers.},

We evaluate the performance of the UMAP algorithm on MSI data sets acquired in mouse pancreas and human lymphoma samples and compare it to those of principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and the Barnes-Hut (BH) approximation of t-SNE. Furthermore, we compare different distance metrics in (BH) t-SNE and UMAP and propose the use of spatial autocorrelation as a means of comparing the resulting low-dimensional embeddings. The results indicate that UMAP is competitive with t-SNE in terms of visualization and is well-suited for the dimensionality reduction of large ({$>$}100 000 pixels) MSI data sets. With an almost fourfold decrease in runtime, it is more scalable in comparison with the current state-of-the-art: t-SNE or the Barnes-Hut approximation of t-SNE. In what seems to be the first application of UMAP to MSI data, we assess the value of applying alternative distance metrics, such as the correlation, cosine, and the Chebyshev metric, in contrast to the traditionally used Euclidean distance metric. Furthermore, we propose ``histomatch'' as an additional custom distance metric for the analysis of MSI data.},

Attempts by philosophers of science to ground such distinctions in abstract principles and by sociologists of science to detect relevant differences (for example, in consensus levels) have met with limited success. However, recent investigations of scientists' concrete practices of data representation provide new leads on this problem. In particular, Bruno Latour has argued that graphs are essential to science due to their ability to render phenomena into compact, transportable and persuasive form. Applying Latour's notion of 'graphism' to the hierarchy of sciences, we found that the use of graphs across seven scientific disciplines correlated almost perfectly with their hardness, and that the same pattern held up across ten specialty fields in psychology.},

It has been used by people on all levels of society, both as a method of divination and as a source of essential ideas about the nature of heaven, earth, and humankind. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Sung dynasty literati turned to it for guidance in their fundamental reworking of the classical traditions. This book explores how four leading thinkers--Su Shih, Shao Yung, Ch'eng I, and Chu Hsi--applied the \emph{I Ching} to these projects. These four men used the Book of Changes in strikingly different ways. Yet each claimed to find in it a sure foundation for human values. Their work established not only new meanings for the text but also new models for governance and moral philosophy that would be debated throughout the next thousand years of Chinese intellectual history. By focusing on their uses of the \emph{I Ching} , this study casts a unique light on the complex continuity-within-change and rich diversity of Sung culture. Originally published in 1990. ThePrinceton Legacy Libraryuses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

We include such aspects as finite lifetime of publication impact and tendency to `defend' one's own opinions, especially if they were already published. A special class of publications, delivering crucial observational or experimental data, which may revolutionize the scientific worldview is considered. The goal of the model is to discover which conditions lead to quick domination of one theory over others, or, conversely, in which situations one may expect several explanations to co-exist.},

  abstract = {There is a significant flaw in today's painting software: the colors do not mix like actual paints. E.g., blue and yellow make gray instead of green. This is because the software is built around the RGB representation, which models the mixing of colored lights. Paints, however, get their color from pigments, whose mixing behavior is predicted by the Kubelka--Munk model (K--M). Although it was introduced to computer graphics almost 30 years ago, the K--M model has never been adopted by painting software in practice as it would require giving up the RGB representation, growing the number of per-pixel channels substantially, and depriving the users of painting with arbitrary RGB colors. In this paper, we introduce a practical approach that enables mixing colors with K--M while keeping everything in RGB. We achieve this by establishing a latent color space, where RGB colors are represented as mixtures of primary pigments together with additive residuals. The latents can be manipulated with linear operations, leading to expected, plausible results. We describe the conversion between RGB and our latent representation, and show how to implement it efficiently.

The diagnosis is mainly derived from an analysis of the widely used Transformer architecture. Here I address a number of misunderstandings in their analysis, and present what I take to be a more adequate analysis of the ability of Transformer models to learn natural language semantics. To avoid confusion, I distinguish between inferential and referential semantics. Landgrebe and Smith (2021)'s analysis of the Transformer architecture's expressivity and generalization concerns inferential semantics. This part of their diagnosis is shown to rely on misunderstandings of technical properties of Transformers. Landgrebe and Smith (2021) also claim that referential semantics is unobtainable for Transformer models. In response, I present a non-technical discussion of techniques for grounding Transformer models, giving them referential semantics, even in the absence of supervision. I also present a simple thought experiment to highlight the mechanisms that would lead to referential semantics, and discuss in what sense models that are grounded in this way, can be said to understand language. Finally, I discuss the approach Landgrebe and Smith (2021) advocate for, namely manual specification of formal grammars that associate linguistic expressions with logical form.},

  abstract = {A common trait of complex systems is that they can be represented by means of a network of interacting parts. It is, in fact, the network organization (more than the parts) that largely conditions most higher-level properties, which are not reducible to the properties of the individual parts. Can the topological organization of these webs provide some insight into their evolutionary origins? Both biological and artificial networks share some common architectural traits. They are often heterogeneous and sparse, and most exhibit different types of correlations, such as nestedness, modularity or hierarchical patterns. These properties have often been attributed to the selection of functionally meaningful traits. However, a proper formulation of generative network models suggests a rather different picture. Against the standard selection--optimization argument, some networks reveal the inevitable generation of complex patterns resulting from reuse and can be modelled using duplication--rewiring rules lacking functionality. These give rise to the observed heterogeneous, scale-free and modular architectures. Here, we examine the evidence for tinkering in cellular, technological and ecological webs and its impact in shaping their architecture. Our analysis suggests a serious consideration of the role played by selection as the origin of network topology. Instead, we suggest that the amplification processes associated with reuse might shape these graphs at the topological level. In biological systems, selection forces would take advantage of emergent patterns.

  abstract = {Discourse relations are typically modeled as a discrete class that characterizes the relation between segments of text (e.g. causal explanations, expansions). However, such predefined discrete classes limits the universe of potential relationships and their nuanced differences. Analogous to contextual word embeddings, we propose representing discourse relations as points in high dimensional continuous space. However, unlike words, discourse relations often have no surface form (relations are between two segments, often with no word or phrase in that gap) which presents a challenge for existing embedding techniques. We present a novel method for automatically creating discourse relation embeddings (DiscRE), addressing the embedding challenge through a weakly supervised, multitask approach to learn diverse and nuanced relations between discourse segments in social media. Results show DiscRE can: (1) obtain the best performance on Twitter discourse relation classification task (macro F1=0.76) (2) improve the state of the art in social media causality prediction (from F 1 = .79 to .81), (3) perform beyond modern sentence and contextual word embeddings at traditional discourse relation classification, and (4) capture novel nuanced relations (e.g. relations semantically at the intersection of causal explanations and counterfactuals).},

Though highly interesting, the study of diagrams still largely lack quantitative investigations which can provide vital background information regarding variations e.g. in the frequency or type of diagrams used in mathematics publication over time.A first attempt at providing such quantitative background information has recently been conducted [9], making it clear that the manual labour required to identify and code diagrams constitutes a major limiting factor in large-scale investigations of diagram-use in mathematics.In order to overcome this limiting factor, we have developed a machine learning tool that is able to identify and count mathematical diagrams in large corpora of mathematics texts. In this paper we report on our experiences with this first attempt to bring machine learning tools to the aid of philosophy of mathematics. We describe how we developed the tool, the choices we made along the way, and how reliable the tool is in identifying mathematical diagrams in corpora outside of its training set. On the basis of these experiences we discuss how machine learning tools can be used to inform philosophical discussions, and we provide some ideas to new and valuable research questions that these novel tools may help answer.},

Yet, due to the incorporation of new mathematical methods such as computer-assisted experimentation in mathematical practice, experiments are now conducted and used in a much broader range of epistemic practices such as concept formation, validation, and communication. In this article, we combine corpus studies and qualitative analyses to assess and categorize the epistemic roles experiments are seen---by mathematicians---to have in actual mathematical practice. We do so by text-mining a corpus of reviews from the               Mathematical Reviews               , which include the indicator word ``experiment''. Our qualitative, grounded classification of samples from this corpus allows us to explore the various roles played by experiments. We thus identify instances where experiments function as references to established knowledge, as tools for heuristics or exploration, as epistemic warrants, as communication or pedagogy, and instances simply proposing experiments. Focusing on the role of experiments as epistemic warrants, we show through additional sampling that in some fields of mathematics, experiments can warrant theorems as well as methods. We also show that the expressed lack of experiments by reviewers suggests concordant views that experiments could have provided epistemic warrants. Thus, our combination of corpus studies and qualitative analyses has added a typology of roles of experiments in mathematical practice and shown that experiments can and do play roles as epistemic warrants depending on the mathematical field.},

In this case study, two different approaches were applied to the University of Vienna. The first relies on funding and rankings information as well as on other esteem indicators. The second is based on a bibliometric analysis of the publication output. We used two alternative clusterings for publications for the bibliometric analysis: Web of Science subject categories and lists of researchers associated with esteem-indicators. Both, esteem-indicators and bibliometric analysis proved to be useful in identifying research strengths, lead to similar results and are meant to be used together to complement each other. We found that the greatest hindrance in the bibliometric approach lies in the inherent limitations of journals-assignment-based classification systems and the considerable time and efforts for more accurate researcher-based publication analyses. Further investigation on this subject, including new and alternative metrics, is needed and will be conducted in the future. However, the preliminary results already demonstrate the benefits of using esteem-factors together with bibliometric analyses for research strengths definition of universities.},

These characterizations are used in various applications, including text classification, better understanding of diseases, and comparison between cities, among others. In particular, texts are also characterized by a hierarchical structure that can be approached by using multi-scale concepts and methods. The present work aims at developing these possibilities while focusing on mesoscopic representations of networks. More specifically, we adopt an extension to the mesoscopic approach to represent text narratives, in which only the recurrent relationships among tagged parts of speech are considered to establish connections among sequential pieces of text (e.g., paragraphs). The characterization of the texts was then achieved by considering scale-dependent complementary methods: accessibility, symmetry and recurrence signatures. In order to evaluate the potential of these concepts and methods, we approached the problem of distinguishing between literary genres (fiction and non-fiction). A set of 300 books organized into the two genres was considered and were compared by using the aforementioned approaches. All the methods were capable of differentiating to some extent between the two genres. The accessibility and symmetry reflected the narrative asymmetries, while the recurrence signature provide a more direct indication about the non-sequential semantic connections taking place along the narrative.},

  abstract = {The present paper shows how statistical learning theory and machine learning models can be used to enhance understanding of AI-related epistemological issues regarding inductive reasoning and reliability of generalisations. Towards this aim, the paper proceeds as follows. First, it expounds Price's dual image of representation in terms of the notions of e-representations and i-representations that constitute subject naturalism. For Price, this is not a strictly anti-representationalist position but rather a dualist one (e- and i-representations). Second, the paper links this debate with machine learning in terms of statistical learning theory becoming more viable epistemological tool when it abandons the perspective of object naturalism. The paper then argues that machine learning grounds a form of knowing that can be understood in terms of e- and i-representation learning. Third, this synthesis shows a way of analysing inductive reasoning in terms of reliability of generalisations stemming from a structure of e- and i-representations. In the age of Artificial Intelligence, connecting Price's dual view of representation with Deep Learning provides an epistemological way forward and even perhaps an approach to how knowing is possible.},

In this review, we explore the various sources of stereotype threat, the mechanisms underlying stereotype-threat effects (both mediators and moderators), and the consequences of this situational predicament, as well as the means through which society and stigmatized individuals can overcome the insidious effects of stereotype threat. Ultimately, we hope this review alleviates some of the confusion surrounding stereotype threat while also sparking further research and debate.},

Some self-identified members of both camps are apt to endorse uncharitable caricatures of what the others are up to. Among the many lines of criticism that can be directed against this false dichotomy, I wish to focus on discussion of a broadly naturalistic orientation that rejects many of the commitments both of paradigmatic analytic philosophy and paradigmatic continental philosophy. For the committed naturalist, the enterprise of philosophy is continuous with that of systematic empirical enquiry into the workings of the world (science). From a naturalistic perspective many of the standard moves of analytic philosophy, such as testing a proposal against `intuitions', are as preposterous as the claims of `continental' and `analytic' philosophers sometimes appear to one another.},

  abstract = {This volume is a serious attempt to open up the subject of European philosophy of science to real thought, and provide the structural basis for the interdisciplinary development of its specialist fields, but also to provoke reflection on the idea of `European philosophy of science'. This efforts should foster a contemporaneous reflection on what might be meant by philosophy of science in Europe and European philosophy of science, and how in fact awareness of it could assist philosophers interpret and motivate their research through a stronger collective identity. The overarching aim is to set the background for a collaborative project organising, systematising, and ultimately forging an identity for, European philosophy of science by creating research structures and developing research networks across Europe to promote its development. As such under the general rubric of `the present situation in the philosophy of science', the emphasis is on as a first step identifying traditions and research structures already present, and the directions in which this research was leading. The European perspective in philosophy of science is the inclusion of the historical roots of current debates and the focus on methodological problems that cross the various sub-disciplines. This historical dimension is complemented by the evident broad scope of European philosophy of science which embodies not only a strong tradition of history and philosophy of science, history of philosophy of science, but also philosophy with respect to the cultural and social sciences as part of (not separate to) the discipline, combined with more traditional philosophical issues and approaches, such as the application of formal methods, the problem of realism, determinism and chance or the natural kinds debate. This consideration of general philosophical questions in science is married to a strong tradition of engaging naturalistically with the particular philosophical issues in individual sciences where there exists a prerogative of being closely schooled in the relevant scientific theory and research context. Additionally, one can refer to particular positions, like `structural realism', as `European', having their origin and their centre of pursuit, and indeed their historical links, in the context of European research.},

In On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History (1840), Carlyle argues for its crucial importance, whereas in War and Peace (1869), Tolstoy denies its very possibility. Carlyle's heroic model attributes to the hero (the leader) a high degree of mastery and control over social and political circumstances, whereas Tolstoy's a-heroic model implies a small degree of personal mastery and much greater constraints on the individual leader. Both models achieved prominence in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, which brought the role of the individual (hero) in history to the forefront of intellectual and political debate throughout Europe. The two models are shown as parts of and important links in long-established traditions; they are internally coherent yet totally contradictory of each other. The comparison of these opposed perceptions of heroic figures in history suggests that they might originate in an ambivalent, polarized perception of power and mastery, and in the sense of individual insecurity in the face of historical upheavals.},

A simple scientific example can befound in the rationale behind the sensible methodological adage that``correlation does not imply causation''. If watching lotsof cartoons causes children to be more violent in their playgroundbehavior, then we should (barring complications) expect to find acorrelation between levels of cartoon viewing and violent playgroundbehavior. But that is also what we would expect to find ifchildren who are prone to violence tend to enjoy and seek out cartoonsmore than other children, or if propensities to violence and increasedcartoon viewing are both caused by some third factor (like generalparental neglect or excessive consumption of Twinkies). So a highcorrelation between cartoon viewing and violent playground behavior isevidence that (by itself) simply underdetermines what weshould believe about the causal relationship between the two. But itturns out that this simple and familiar predicament only scratches thesurface of the various ways in which problems of underdeterminationcan arise in the course of scientific investigation.},

The main argument in the paper is inspired by considerations known as the ``collapse problem'', and it aims at the most popular form of logical pluralism advocated by JC Beall and Greg Restall. I argue that there is a more general argument available that challenges all variants of logical pluralism that meet the following three conditions: (i) that there are at least two correct logical systems characterized in terms of different consequence relations, (ii) that there is some sort of rivalry among the correct logics, and (iii) that logical consequence is normative.

But how could this leave room for a learning theory, that shows that some algorithms are better than others? Drawing parallels to the philosophy of induction, we point out that the no-free-lunch results presuppose a conception of learning algorithms as purely data-driven. On this conception, every algorithm must have an inherent inductive bias, that wants justification. We argue that many standard learning algorithms should rather be understood as model-dependent: in each application they also require for input a model, representing a bias. Generic algorithms themselves, they can be given a model-relative justification.},

  abstract = {Data science and psychiatry have diverse epistemic cultures that come together in data-driven initiatives (e.g., big data, machine learning). The literature on these initiatives seems to either downplay or overemphasize epistemic differences between the fields. In this paper, we study the convergence and divergence of the epistemic cultures of data science and psychiatry. This approach is more likely to capture where and how the cultures differ and gives insights into how practitioners from both fields find ways to work together despite their differences. We introduce the notions of "epistemic virtues" to focus on epistemic differences ethnographically, and "trading zones" to concentrate on how differences are negotiated. This leads us to the following research question: how are epistemic differences negotiated by data science and psychiatry practitioners in a hospital-based data-driven initiative? Our results are based on an ethnographic study in which we observed a Dutch psychiatric hospital department developing prediction models of patient outcomes based on machine learning techniques (September 2017 - February 2018). Many epistemic virtues needed to be negotiated, such as completeness or selectivity in data inclusion. These differences were traded locally and temporarily, stimulated by shared epistemic virtues (such as a systematic approach), boundary objects and socialization processes. Trading became difficult when virtues were too diverse, differences were enlarged by storytelling and parties did not have the time or capacity to learn about the other. In the discussion, we argue that our combined theoretical framework offers a fresh way to study how cooperation between diverse practitioners goes and where it can be improved. We make a call for bringing epistemic differences into the open as this makes a grounded discussion possible about the added value of data-driven initiatives and the role they can play in healthcare.},

While such changes may be analyzed and interpreted from a variety of sources, we utilize recent advancements in the quantitative analysis of culture to identify how these changes are encoded within Ukraine's legislation. Our goal is to provide a new picture of Ukrainian governance that may be used by subject matter experts as a complement to existing forms of political data. To do so, we apply probabilistic topic modeling to compress over a decade of Ukrainian legislation into patterns of word usage. We then apply a recently developed calculation of novelty to measure how different each draft law is from the draft laws which precede it. We find an interesting pattern of legislative changes and identify some of the drivers of these changes. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our results and the broader context of Ukrainian political changes and suggest steps to explore this relationship further.},

In our approach, which we call Concept Mover's Distance, a document is measured by the minimum distance the words in the document need to travel to arrive at the position of a ``pseudo document'' consisting of only words denoting a focal concept. This approach captures the prototypical structure of concepts, is fairly robust to pruning sparse terms as well as variation in text lengths within a corpus, and with pre-trained embeddings, can be used even when terms denoting concepts are absent from corpora and can be applied to bag-of-words datasets. We close by outlining some limitations of the proposed method as well as opportunities for future research.},

This article argues that institutional dynamics of American higher education played a decisive role in the creation of this divide. Through quantitative analysis of the hiring and promotion of philosophers, it demonstrates how hierarchies and informal academic networks established boundaries for mainstream American philosophy that excluded modern European thought. Following the end of World War II, as American universities expanded, philosophy departments nearly tripled in size. However, the discipline was dominated by a Brahmin caste of elite departments that hired its own graduates almost exclusively. In this environment, the invidious distinction between the ``elite'' analytic departments and heterodox departments at the discipline's periphery was mapped onto the styles of philosophy practiced at those schools, and shaped America's reception of ``Continental'' European philosophy.},

The LATEX document we used is part of the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) project of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and obeys project-specific conventions, which contains macros for mathematical constructions, among them 200 predefined macros for special functions, the subject matter of the project. The SGLR parser can parse general context-free languages, which suffices to extract the structure of mathematical formulas from calculus that are written in the usual mathematical style, with most parentheses and multiplication signs omitted. The parse tree is then rewritten into a more concise and uniform internal syntax that is used as the base for extracting MathML or other semantical information.},

  abstract = {Small incremental biological change, winnowed by natural selection over geological time scales to produce large consequences, was Darwin's singular insight that revolutionized the life sciences. His publications after 1859, including the 'earthworm book', were all written to amplify and support the evolutionary theory presented in the Origin. Darwin was unable to provide a physical basis for the inheritance of favoured traits because of the absence of genetic knowledge that much later led to the 'modern synthesis'. Mistaken though he was in advocating systemic 'gemmules' as agents of inheritance, Darwin was perceptive in seeking to underpin his core vision with concrete factors that both determine the nature of a trait in one generation and convey it to subsequent generations. This brief review evaluates the molecular genetic literature on earthworms published during the last decade, and casts light on the specific aspects of earthworm evolutionary biology that more or less engaged Darwin: (i) biogeography, (ii) species diversity, (iii) local adaptations and (iv) sensitivity. We predict that the current understanding will deepen with the announcement of a draft earthworm genome in Darwin's bicentenary year, 2009. Subsequently, the earthworm may be elevated from the status of a soil sentinel to that elusive entity, an ecologically relevant genetic model organism.},

It approaches the notion of representation in a deflationary spirit, and minimally characterizes the concept as it appears in science by means of two necessary conditions: its essential directionality and its capacity to allow surrogate reasoning and inference. The conception is defended by showing that it successfully meets the objections that make its competitors, such as isomorphism and similarity, untenable. In addition the inferential conception captures the objectivity of the cognitive representations used by science, it sheds light on their truth and completeness, and it explains the source of the analogy between scientific and artistic modes of representation.},

In this work, we provide the Hodge decomposition, coupled with discrete exterior calculus (DEC), to unveil cell dynamics by examining the decomposed curl-free, divergence-free, and harmonic components of the RNA velocity field in a low dimensional representation, such as a UMAP or a t-SNE representation. Decomposition results show that the decomposed components distinctly reveal key cell dynamic features such as cell cycle, bifurcation, and cell lineage differentiation, regardless of the choice of the low-dimensional representations. The consistency across different representations demonstrates that the Hodge decomposition is a reliable and robust way to extract these cell dynamic features, offering unique analysis and insightful visualization of single-cell RNA velocity fields.},

This paper aims to study the way we collaborate, model the dynamics of collaborations and predict future collaborations among authors. We investigate the collaborations in three disciplines including physics, computer science and information science,and different kinds of features which may influence the creation of collaborations. Path-based features are found to be particularly useful in predicting collaborations. Besides, the combination of path-based and attribute-based features achieves almost the same performance as the combination of all features considered. Inspired by the findings, we propose an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of collaborations. The model merges the ideas of network structure and node attributes by leveraging random walk mechanism and interests similarity. Empirical results show that the model could reproduce a number of realistic and critical network statistics and patterns. We further apply the model to predict collaborations in an unsupervised manner and compare it with several state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed model achieves the best predictive performance compared with the random baseline and other approaches. The results suggest that both network structure and node attributes may play an important role in shaping the evolution of collaboration networks.},

No quantitative model to date allows us to validate competing theories on the different roles of endogenous processes, such as social collaborations and exogenous events, such as scientific discoveries. Here we propose an agent-based model in which the evolution of disciplines is guided mainly by social interactions among agents representing scientists. Disciplines emerge from splitting and merging of social communities in a collaboration network. We find that this social model can account for a number of stylized facts about the relationships between disciplines, scholars and publications. These results provide strong quantitative support for the key role of social interactions in shaping the dynamics of science. While several ``science of science'' theories exist, this is the first account for the emergence of disciplines that is validated on the basis of empirical data.},

  abstract = {We provide a unifying view of a large family of previous imitation learning algorithms through the lens of moment matching. At its core, our classification scheme is based on whether the learner attempts to match (1) reward or (2) action-value moments of the expert's behavior, with each option leading to differing algorithmic approaches. By considering adversarially chosen divergences between learner and expert behavior, we are able to derive bounds on policy performance that apply for all algorithms in each of these classes, the first to our knowledge. We also introduce the notion of moment recoverability, implicit in many previous analyses of imitation learning, which allows us to cleanly delineate how well each algorithmic family is able to mitigate compounding errors. We derive three novel algorithm templates (AdVIL, AdRIL, and DAeQuIL) with strong guarantees, simple implementation, and competitive empirical performance.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a generic agent-based model simulating the exchange and the di usion of pro and con arguments. It is applied to the case of the di usion of vegetarian diets in the context of a potential emergence of a second nutrition transition. To this day, agent-based simulation has been extensively used to study opinion dynamics. However, the vast majority of existing models have been limited to extremely abstract and simplified representations of the di usion process. These simplifications impairs the realism of the simulations and disables the understanding of the reasons for the shi of an actor's opinion. The generic model presented here explicitly represents exchanges of arguments between actors in the context of an opinion dynamic model. In particular, the inner attitude towards an opinion of each agent is formalized as an argumentation graph and each agent can share arguments with other agents. Simulation experiments show that introducing attacks between arguments and a limitation of the number of arguments mobilized by agents has a strong impact on the evolution of the agents' opinion. We also highlight that when a new argument is introduced into the system, the quantity and the profile of the agents receiving the new argument will impact the evolution of the overall opinion. Finally, the application of this model to vegetarian diet adoption seems consistent with historical food behaviour dynamics observed during crises.},

We successfully replicate two studies originally conducted by Michael and Szigeti (Philos Explor 22:44--61, 2019), who observed this effect and provide empirical evidence of the existence of two related effects---Group Epistemic and Doxastic Knobe Effects---which show analogous asymmetry with respect to knowledge and belief ascriptions. We explain how the existence of the Group Knobe Effect and its epistemic and doxastic counterparts affects the philosophical debate on collective agency and intentionality and supports the intuitiveness of realism about collective agency among laypeople. We also critically assess the reasoning presented by Michael and Szigeti (2019) in favor of the realist-collectivist interpretation of their results (as opposed to the realist-distributivist interpretation). We argue that a thorough analysis of both their data and our new findings shows a rather wide range of differing intuitions among laypeople regarding the status of groups as agents. These results show that while some laypeople may have realist-collectivist intuitions, the contrary realist-distrubutivist intuitions are also widespread and the claim that the majority of laypeople hold collectivist intuitions regarding group agency is unjustified.},

Since we provide both a planar and a spherical version of the algorithm, it is suitable for simulating trajectories ranging from the local scale up to the (inter-) continental scale, as exemplified by the movement of migrating birds. The algorithm accounts for physical limitations, including maximum speed and maximum movement time, and provides the user with either single or multiple trajectories as a result. Single trajectories generated by the RTG algorithm can be used as a null model to test hypotheses about movement stimuli, while the multiple trajectories can be used to create a probability density surface akin to Brownian bridges.},

  abstract = {Understanding the cognitive and emotional perceptions of people who commit suicide is one of the most sensitive scientific challenges. There are circumstances where people feel the need to leave something written, an artifact where they express themselves, registering their last words and feelings. These suicide notes are of utmost importance for better understanding the psychology of suicidal ideation. This work gives structure to the linguistic content of suicide notes, revealing interconnections between cognitive and emotional states of people who committed suicide. We build upon cognitive network science, psycholinguistics and semantic frame theory to introduce a network representation of the mindset expressed in suicide notes. Our cognitive network representation enables the quantitative analysis of the language in suicide notes through structural balance theory, semantic prominence and emotional profiling. Our results indicate that the emotional syntax connecting positively- and negatively-valenced terms gives rise to a degree of structural balance that is significantly higher than null models where the affective structure was randomized. We show that suicide notes are affectively compartmentalized such that positive concepts tend to cluster together and dominate the overall network structure. A key positive concept is ``love'', which integrates information relating the self to others in ways that are semantically prominent across suicide notes. The emotions populating the semantic frame of ``love'' combine joy and trust with anticipation and sadness, which connects with psychological theories about meaning-making and narrative psychology. Our results open new ways for understanding the structure of genuine suicide notes informing future research for suicide prevention.},

Proposed drivers of regime shifts include changes in grazing, spatial clustering, and ocean temperature. Here we distill the dynamic regimes of coral-macroalgal interaction into a three-dimensional geometry, akin to thermodynamic phase diagrams of state transitions, to facilitate analysis. Specific regime-shifting forces can be understood as bifurcation vectors through the cubic regime geometry. This geometric perspective allows us to understand multiple forces simultaneously in terms of the stability and persistence of interacting species. For example, in a coral-macroalgae community, grazing on macroalgae can lead to alternative stable states when there is no spatial clustering (e.g., high habitat connectivity). However, with spatial clustering, grazing can lead to coexistence because of elevated local intraspecific competition. The geometrical analysis of regime shifts is applicable to any two-species communities and can help conservation efforts navigate complexity and abrupt changes.},

This paper presents the largest study to date on gender bias, where we compare acceptance rates of contributions from men versus women in an open source software community. Surprisingly, our results show that women's contributions tend to be accepted more often than men's. However, when a woman's gender is identifiable, they are rejected more often. Our results suggest that although women on GitHub may be more competent overall, bias against them exists nonetheless.},

How primates navigate the multidimensional social relationships that structure daily life4 and shape survival and reproductive success5 remains largely unclear at the single-neuron level. Here we combine ethological analysis, computer vision and wireless recording technologies to identify neural signatures of natural behaviour in unrestrained, socially interacting pairs of rhesus macaques. Single-neuron and population activity in the prefrontal and temporal cortex robustly encoded 24 species-typical behaviours, as well as social context. Male--female partners demonstrated near-perfect reciprocity in grooming, a key behavioural mechanism supporting friendships and alliances6, and neural activity maintained a running account of these social investments. Confronted with an aggressive intruder, behavioural and neural population responses reflected empathy and were buffered by the presence of a partner. Our findings reveal a highly distributed neurophysiological ledger of social dynamics, a potential computational foundation supporting communal life in primate societies, including our own.},

This paper lays out the technique and its efficacy. Although this is a difficult dataset to evaluate immediately, Concreteness estimates computed from English correlate with Dutch experimental norms at {$\rho$} = .75 in the vocabulary at large, increasing to {$\rho$} = .8 among Nouns. Our predictions also recapitulate attested relationships with word frequency. The approach we describe can be readily applied to numerous lexical measures beyond Concreteness.},

This empirical research as well as research on the gender gap in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields has shed light on a priori, armchair explanations of the gender gap. For example, implicit bias and stereotype threat may contribute much less to the philosophy gender gap than previously thought. However, new candidate contributing factors have emerged. Drawing on the theoretical resources concerning fixed mindsets in response to difficult tasks, a new theory suggests that practitioners in various fields, including philosophy, hold the belief that success in their fields requires natural brilliance (a brilliance-based field-specific ability belief). Further, the extent to which members of a field hold that belief predicts the diversity of the members of that field. Initial findings suggest that among the set of students who hold these beliefs, women are disproportionately disinterested in continuing in philosophy. Other hypotheses seem plausible, such as the idea that lay people hold gendered schemas about philosophy, but require more empirical support to be partial explanations. Future empirical research should focus on these plausible hypotheses, replications of previous findings, and investigating the effects of intersectionality within the gender gap.},

Men had more severe negative symptoms, poorer premorbid functioning, and poorer social networks, whereas women had more severe hallucinations. More men than women were substance abusers, were unemployed, and lived alone. Women had poorer self-esteem than men, in spite of better scores in functioning. Premorbid social adjustment was significantly related to the level of negative symptoms and number of friends. Conclusion is that men and women with first-episode psychosis showed different psychopathological characteristics and different social functioning, which cannot be explained by older age of onset for women.

  abstract = {Model transfer refers to the observation that particular model structures are used across multiple distinct scientific domains. This paper puts forward an account to explain the inter-domain transfer of model structures. Central in the account is the role of validation criteria in determining whether a model is considered to be useful by practitioners. Validation criteria are points of reference to which model correctness for a particular purpose is assessed. I argue that validation criteria can be categorized as being mathematical, theoretical or phenomenological in nature. Model transfer is explained by overlap in validation criteria between scientific domains. Particular emphasis is placed on overlap between phenomenological criteria. Overlap in phenomenological criteria can be explained through the notion of universal patterns. Universal patterns are abstract structures that can be made to refer to multiple distinct phenomena when coupled with phenomena-specific empirical content. I present the case study of the Yule Process, in which universal patterns play a crucial role in explaining model transfer. This paper provides an account of model transfer that stays close to modelling practice and expands existing accounts by introducing the notion of universal patterns.},

  abstract = {WarningIf protection rackets represent organized crime at its smoothest, then war making and state making -- quintessential protection rackets with the advantage of legitimacy -- qualify as our largest examples of organized crime. Without branding all generals and statesmen as murderers or thieves, I want to urge the value of that analogy. At least for the European experience of the past few centuries, a portrait of war makers and state makers as coercive and self-seeking entrepreneurs bears a far greater resemblance to the facts than do its chief alternatives: the idea of a social contract, the idea of an open market in which operators of armies and states offer services to willing consumers, the idea of a society whose shared norms and expectations call forth a certain kind of government.The reflections that follow merely illustrate the analogy of war making and state making with organized crime from a few hundred years of European experience and offer tentative arguments concerning principles of change and variation underlying the experience. My reflections grow from contemporary concerns: worries about the increasing destructiveness of war, the expanding role of great powers as suppliers of arms and military organization to poor countries, and the growing importance of military rule in those same countries. They spring from the hope that the European experience, properly understood, will help us to grasp what is happening today, perhaps even to do something about it.},

We survey this activity in four parts. In the first part we cover nonlinear methods such as principal curves, multidimensional scaling, local linear methods, ISOMAP, graph based methods and kernel based methods. The second part is concerned with topological embedding methods, in particular mapping topological properties into persistence diagrams. Another type of data sets with a tremendous growth is very high-dimensional network data. The task considered in part three is how to embed such data in a vector space of moderate dimension to make the data amenable to traditional techniques such as cluster and classification techniques. The final part of the survey deals with embedding in R2, which is visualization. Three methods are presented: t-SNE, UMAP and LargeVis based on methods in parts one, two and three, respectively. The methods are illustrated and compared on two simulated data sets; one consisting of a triple of noisy Ranunculoid curves, and one consisting of networks of increasing complexity and with two types of nodes.},

What is the logical probability --- given only that evidence --- that at least one of those n events is such that the totality of the rightmaking and wrongmaking properties, both known and unknown, of allowing that event makes that action morally wrong? Answering this question is the task of this chapter and it requires a rigorous application of inductive logic. It is shown that a Carnapian, structure-description approach entails that the probability must be less than ( 1 n + 1 ) . But the existence of such an event is logically incompatible with the existence of God, and so the probability that God exists, relative to evidence of the sort described, must be less than ( 1 n + 1 ) .},

  abstract = {The similarity view of scientific representation has recently been subjected to strong criticism. Much of this criticism has been directed against a `naive' similarity account, which tries to explain representation solely in terms of similarity between scientific models and the world. This article examines the more sophisticated account offered by the similarity view's leading proponent, Ronald Giere. In contrast to the naive account, Giere's account appeals to the role played by the scientists using a scientific model. A similar move is often made by defenders of resemblance theories of depiction, who invoke the role played by the artist, or by the viewers of a painting. In this article I look to debates over depiction to assess the difficulties facing those who wish to defend the similarity view of scientific representation. I then turn to examine Giere's account. Ultimately, I argue, this account is unsuccessful: while appealing to the role of scientists offers a promising way to defend the similarity view, Giere's own account does not capture what it is that scientists do when they use a model to represent the world.},

  abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

We also describe the main strengths and limitations of this approach for questions with public health relevance. Finally, we describe both methodologic and substantive future directions that we believe will enhance the value of agent-based modeling for public health. In particular, advances in model validation, comparisons with other causal modeling procedures, and the expansion of the models to consider comorbidity and joint influences more systematically will improve the utility of this approach to inform public health research, practice, and policy.},

Such an interpretation renders Hobbes's philosophy more palatable to contemporary society. Yet the claim is incorrect. Alongside his notion of "private" conscience, namely, Hobbes develops a conception of conscience as a public phenomenon. In the following, it is argued that this inconsistency serves the purpose of deception: it holds out the possibility of dissent while making it impossible to utilise. Arguably, moreover, this is the proper hermeneutical approach to take to Hobbes's inconsistencies in general. Indeed, said inconsistencies ought to alert contemporary normative theorists to the instability of the "minimal" version of liberty of conscience attributed to Hobbes: Hobbes himself, namely, shows that it is insufficient.},

  abstract = {The growing availability of large diachronic corpora of scientific literature offers the opportunity of reading the temporal evolution of concepts, methods and applications, i.e., the history of disciplines involved in the strand under investigation. After a retrieval process of the most relevant keywords, bag-of-words approaches produce words\,\,{\texttimes}\,\,time-points contingency tables, i.e. the frequencies of each word in the set of texts grouped by time-points. Through the analysis of word counts over the observed period of time, main purpose of the study is, after reconstructing the ``life-cycle'' of words, clustering words that have similar life-cycles and, thus, detecting prototypical or exemplary temporal patterns. Unveiling such relevant and (through expert opinion) meaningful inner dynamics enables us to trace a historical narrative of the discipline of interest. However, different history readings are possible depending on the type of data normalization, which is needed to account for the fluctuating size of texts across time and the general problems of data sparsity and strong asymmetry. This study proposes a methodology consisting of (1) a stepwise information retrieval procedure for keywords' selection and (2) a functional clustering two-stage approach for statistical learning. Moreover, a sample of possible normalizations of word frequencies is considered, showing that the different concept of curve similarity induced in clustering by the type of transformation heavily affects groups' composition and size. The corpus of titles of scientific papers published by the American Statistical Association journals in the time span 1888--2012 is examined for illustration.},

  abstract = {The overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is published as text, which is difficult to analyse by either traditional statistical analysis or modern machine learning methods. By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases1,2, which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing3--10, which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings11--13 (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure--property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature.},

Whether social influence promotes the spread of accurate information and ultimately results in adaptive behavior or leads to false information cascades and maladaptive social contagion strongly depends on the cognitive mechanisms underlying social interactions. Here we argue that cognitive modeling, in tandem with experiments that allow collective dynamics to emerge, can mechanistically link cognitive processes at the individual and collective levels. We illustrate the strength of this cognitive computational approach with two highly successful cognitive models that have been applied to interactive group experiments: evidence accumulation and reinforcement learning models. We show how these approaches make it possible to simultaneously study (i) how individual cognition drives social systems, (ii) how social systems drive individual cognition, and (iii) the dynamic feedback processes between the two layers.},

Progress has been limited by the availability of quantitative data to test competing theories, by divergent ideas regarding both predictor and outcomes variables, and by differences of opinion over methodology. To address all these problems, we utilize Seshat: Global History Databank, a large storehouse of information designed to test theories concerning the evolutionary drivers of social complexity. In addition to the Big Gods hypothesis, which proposes that moralizing religion contributed to the success of increasingly large-scale complex societies, we consider the role of warfare, animal husbandry, and agricultural productivity in the rise of moralizing religions. Using a broad range of new measures of belief in moralizing supernatural punishment, we find strong support for previous research showing that such beliefs did not drive the rise of social complexity. By contrast, our analyses indicate that intergroup warfare, supported by resource availability, played a major role in the evolution of both social complexity and moralizing religions. Thus, the correlation between social complexity and moralizing religion would seem to result from shared evolutionary drivers, rather than from direct causal relationships between these two variables.},

We focus on 30 Natural Geographic Areas (NGAs) distributed over 10 major world regions (Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Central Eurasia, North America, South America, and Oceania). The conceptual framework that we use to obtain these estimates combines the influences of the production technologies (and how they change with time), climate change, and effects of artificial selection into a Relative Yield Coefficient, indicating how agricultural productivity changed over time in each NGA between the Neolithic and the 20th century. We then use estimates of historical yield in each NGA to translate the Relative Yield Coefficient into an Estimated Yield (tonnes per hectare per year) trajectory. We tested the proposed methodology in two ways. For eight NGAs, in which we had more than one historical yield estimate, we used the earliest estimate to anchor the trajectory and compared the ensuing trajectory to the remaining estimates. We also compared the end points of the estimated NGA trajectories to the earliest (the 1960s decade) FAO data on crop productivities in the modern countries encompassing Seshat NGAs. We discuss the benefits of this methodology over previous efforts to estimate agricultural productivities in world history.},

Here we analyze the evolution of key military technologies in a sample of preindustrial societies world-wide covering almost 10,000 years of history using Seshat: Global History Databank. We empirically test previously speculative theories that proposed world population size, connectivity between geographical areas of innovation and adoption, and critical enabling technological advances, such as iron metallurgy and horse riding, as central drivers of military technological evolution. We find that all of these factors are strong predictors of change in military technology, whereas state-level factors such as polity population, territorial size, or governance sophistication play no major role. We discuss how our approach can be extended to explore technological change more generally, and how our results carry important ramifications for understanding major drivers of evolution of social complexity.},

In this article we discuss two influential ideas from the theory of biological evolution that can inform this debate: the contrast between the micro- and macro-evolution, and the distinction between the tempo and mode of evolution. We add the empirical depth to these ideas by summarizing recent results from the analyses of data on past societies in Seshat: Global History Databank. Our review of these results suggests that the tempo (rates of change, including their acceleration and deceleration) of cultural macroevolution is characterized by periods of apparent stasis interspersed by rapid change. Furthermore, when we focus on large-scale changes in cultural traits of whole groups, the most important macroevolutionary mode involves inter-polity interactions, including competition and warfare, but also cultural exchange and selective imitation; mechanisms that are key components of cultural multilevel selection (CMLS) theory.},

Is there perhaps something that culture has but biological inheritance does not that would account for this difference? We present a novel model that combines assortative interaction and multidimensional inheritance. Our computer simulations show that assortment alone can lead to the formation of cohesive clusters of individuals with low within-group and large between-group variability even in the absence of a spatial separation or disruptive natural selection. All it takes is a proportionality between the variance of inputs (cultural `parents') and outputs (cultural `offspring'). We argue that variability-dependent inheritance cannot be easily accomplished by genes alone, but it may be the norm, not the exception, in the transmission of culture between humans. This model explains the frequent emergence of subcultures and behavioural clustering in our species and possibly also other cultural animals.},

Due to its lexicon-based approach with a design focus on social media texts, no additional training data is required. In this paper the process of creating VADER is applied to build a German adaptation which is called GerVADER. The paper will present the concept of VADER and how a German version can be built within reasonable time. GerVADER uses SentiWS as a starting point for the lexicon, combines it with language independent parts of the VADER lexicon and copies the process of having users rate the words intensity and polarity. The next step is comprised of comparing the algorithmically changes due to the natural differences in language between German and English. Then GerVADER is compared to the results of the SB10k [2] corpus classification which contains more than 9000 human labeled tweets. Finally GerVADER is tested with parts of the SCARE [3] dataset which contains reviews for mobile apps. The results show that GerVADER lacks some additional work to increase its classification accuracy, but it promises better results considering how well the original performed.},

The method handles heterogeneous data sets, and leads to coherent schemes for compressing, denoising, and imputing missing entries across all data types simultaneously.

  abstract = {An on--line algorithm is presented for constructing the suffix tree for a given string in time linear in the length of the string. The new algorithm has the desirable property of processing the string symbol by symbol from left to right. It has always the suffix tree for the scanned part of the string ready. The method is developed as a linear--time version of a very simple algorithm for (quadratic size) suffix tries. Regardless of its quadratic worst-case this latter algorithm can be a good practical method when the string is not too long. Another variation of this method is shown to give in a natural way the well--known algorithms for constructing suffix automata (DAWGs).},

To overcome this burden, we must decipher the state-space attractor dynamics of gene expression patterns and protein oscillations orchestrated by cancer stemness networks. The review provides an overview of dynamical systems theory to steer cancer research in pattern science. While most of our current tools in network medicine rely on statistical correlation methods, causality inference remains primitively developed. As such, a survey of attractor reconstruction methods and machine algorithms for the detection of causal structures applicable in experimentally derived time series cancer datasets is presented. A toolbox of complex systems approaches are discussed for reconstructing the signaling state space of cancer networks, interpreting causal relationships in their time series gene expression patterns, and assisting clinical decision making in computational oncology. As a proof of concept, the applicability of some algorithms are demonstrated on pediatric brain cancer datasets and the requirement of their time series analysis is highlighted.},

(p. 468) studied 17.9 million research articles across five decades of the Web of Science, the largest repository of scientific research. Scientific work typically appeared to draw on highly conventional, familiar mixtures of knowledge. The highest-impact papers were not the ones that had the greatest novelty, but had a combination of novelty and otherwise conventional combinations of prior work. Novelty is an essential feature of creative ideas, yet the building blocks of new ideas are often embodied in existing knowledge. From this perspective, balancing atypical knowledge with conventional knowledge may be critical to the link between innovativeness and impact. Our analysis of 17.9 million papers spanning all scientific fields suggests that science follows a nearly universal pattern: The highest-impact science is primarily grounded in exceptionally conventional combinations of prior work yet simultaneously features an intrusion of unusual combinations. Papers of this type were twice as likely to be highly cited works. Novel combinations of prior work are rare, yet teams are 37.7\% more likely than solo authors to insert novel combinations into familiar knowledge domains. Highly cited work is simultaneously conventional and unconventional. Highly cited work is simultaneously conventional and unconventional.},

Recently, one of these models has been introduced in the philosophy of science by De Cruz and De Smedt (Philos Stud 157:411--429, 2012), in an attempt to demonstrate that scientists may collectively come to hold more truth-approximating beliefs, despite the cognitive biases which they individually are known to be subject to. Here we identify a major shortcoming in that attempt: De Cruz \& De Smedt's mathematical model makes one particularly strong tractability assumption that causes the model to largely miss its target (namely, truth accumulation in science), and that moreover conflicts with empirical observations. The second, more constructive part of the paper presents an alternative, agent-based model, which allows one to much better examine the conditions for scientific progress and decline.},

However, historians have paid little attention to his radical theoretical challenges to mainline eugenic concepts of mental disease. Working from a classification system developed with his colleague, E.O. Lewis, Penrose developed a statistically sophisticated and clinically grounded refutation of the popular position that low intelligence is inherently a disease state. In the early 1930s, Penrose advocated dividing "mental defect'' (low intelligence) into two categories: "pathological mental defect,'' which is a disease state that can be traced to a distinct genetic or environmental cause, and "subcultural mental defect,'' which is not an inherent disease state, but rather a statistically necessary manifestation of human variation in intelligence. I explore the historical context and theoretical import of this contribution, discussing its rejection of typological thinking and noting that it preceded Theodosius Dobzhansky's better-known defense of human diversity. I illustrate the importance of Penrose's contribution with a discussion of an analogous situation in contemporary medicine, the controversial practice of using human growth hormone injections to treat "idiopathic short stature'' (mere diminutive height, with no distinct cause). I show how Penrose's contributions to understanding human variation make such treatments appear quite misguided. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Public reason liberalism includes an ideal of political stability where justified institutions reach a kind of self-enforcing equilibrium. Such an order must be stable for the right reasons -- where persons comply with the rules of the order for moral reasons, rather than out of fear or self-interest. John Rawls called a society stable in this way well-ordered. In this essay, I contend that a more sophisticated model of a well-ordered society, specifically an agent-based model, yields a richer and more attractive understanding of political stability. An agent-based model helps us to distinguish between three concepts of political stability -- durability, balance, and immunity. A well-ordered society is one that possesses a high degree of social trust and cooperative behavior among its citizens (durability) with low short-run variability (balance). A well-ordered society also resists destabilization caused by noncompliant agents in or entering the system (immunity). Distinguishing between these three concepts complicates the necessary reformulation of the idea of a well-ordered society. Going forward, public reason theorists must now distinguish between types of assurance, specify heretofore unknown aspects of reasonable behavior, and reconceive of the nonideal preconditions for forming a stable, ideal social order.},

Although my special focus here will be the manifestation of this virtue of scientific character in experimental/observational praxis, I will show how this virtue functions in both experimental and theoretical contexts, and is in fact critical to the excellent function of each as a guide and constraint for the other. While there is no English term that captures precisely the meaning of the virtue I shall emphasize, the nearest approximation would be perceptual responsiveness. The virtue of being perceptually responsive is conceptually complex, and will require precise definition and clarification.},

  abstract = {The existing literature on modelling provides two main ways of viewing model migration: a modular view, which seeks to decompose models in their constitutive elements, and thus provides a view on what it is that migrates; and a practice-based view, which focuses on modelling as an activity, and understands a model as intricately entangled with its context of use. This article brings together these two sensitivities by focusing on ontologies of modelling. The paper presents a case study of the appropriation of modern finance theory's `no-arbitrage' models by British actuaries -- a process that gradually unfolded at around the turn of the century and led to significant friction within the UK's insurance industry. We can distinguish two main modelling ontologies: a `risk-neutral ontology', which underpins no-arbitrage models and holds that the value of financial instruments is determined by `arbitrage'; and, a `real-world ontology', which assumes that the economic world consists of real probabilities that may be approximated through a combination of archival-statistical methods and expert judgment. The appropriation of the risk-neutral modelling ontology was made possible by the declining legitimacy of actuarial expertise as `financial stewards' of life insurance companies. The risk-neutral modelling ontology provided an `objective' alternative to the traditional actuarial models, which explicitly required actuaries to make `prudent' judgments. Despite the fact that the no-arbitrage modelling was considered an `objective' affair, the valuation models that insurers use today are strongly shaped by political compromises, a result of the `rough edges' of models.},

Because a single number only provides a general notion of what is going on, the values of such overall indices (usually between 0 and 1) are often difficult to interpret. In this paper, we show that a class of normalizations of the mutual information can be decomposed into indices that contain information on the level of individual clusters. The decompositions (1) reveal that overall measures can be interpreted as summary statistics of information reflected in the individual clusters, (2) specify how these overall indices are related to individual clusters, and (3) show that the overall indices are affected by cluster size imbalance. We recommend to use measures for individual clusters since they provide much more detailed information than a single overall number.},

In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during development. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the Flynn effect.},

As a result, the visualizations are subject to the fundamental limitations of metric spaces. These limitations prevent multidimensional scaling from faithfully representing non-metric similarity data such as word associations or event co-occurrences. In particular, multidimensional scaling cannot faithfully represent intransitive pairwise similarities in a visualization, and it cannot faithfully visualize ``central'' objects. In this paper, we present an extension of a recently proposed multidimensional scaling technique called t-SNE. The extension aims to address the problems of traditional multidimensional scaling techniques when these techniques are used to visualize non-metric similarities. The new technique, called multiple maps t-SNE, alleviates these problems by constructing a collection of maps that reveal complementary structure in the similarity data. We apply multiple maps t-SNE to a large data set of word association data and to a data set of NIPS co-authorships, demonstrating its ability to successfully visualize non-metric similarities.},

Several authors have voiced concerns about the presence of retracted research in the memory of science. In particular, a retracted result is propagated by citing it. In the published literature, many instances are given of retracted articles that are cited both before and after their retraction. Even worse is the possibility that these articles in turn are cited in such a way that the retracted result is propagated further. Methods: We have conducted a case study to find out how a retracted article is cited and whether retracted results are propagated through indirect citations. We have constructed the entire citation network for this case. Results: We show that directly citing articles is an important source of propagation of retracted research results. In contrast, in our case study, indirect citations do not contribute to the propagation of the retracted result. Conclusions: While admitting the limitations of a study involving a single case, we think there are reasons for the non-contribution of indirect citations that hold beyond our case study.},

We have implemented the model using an agent-based modeling approach. The multi-agent model contains the social network structure, individual behavior parameters and the scenario that are obtained from empirical data. The model is validated by comparing the output of the multi-agent simulation with empirical data. We demonstrate the method by evaluating five versions of behavior models applied to the use case of Twitter behavior about a talent show on Dutch television.},

These nonlinear effects are common to all cities, with similar power law exponents. These findings mean that the larger the city, the more disproportionally they are places of wealth and innovation. Local properties of cities cause a deviation from the expected behavior as predicted by the power law scaling. In this paper we demonstrate that universities show a similar behavior as cities in the distribution of the `gross university income' in terms of total number of citations over `size' in terms of total number of publications. Moreover, the power law exponents for university scaling are comparable to those for urban scaling. We find that deviations from the expected behavior can indeed be explained by specific local properties of universities, particularly the field-specific composition of a university, and its quality in terms of fieldnormalized citation impact. By studying both the set of the 500 largest universities worldwide and a specific subset of these 500 universities -the top-100 European universities- we are also able to distinguish between properties of universities with as well as without selection of one specific local property, the quality of a university in terms of its average field-normalized citation impact. It also reveals an interesting observation concerning the working of a crucial property in networked systems, preferential attachment.},

This is a precise but time-consuming approach, in which the researcher focuses on one particular text passage or one philosophical concept from one or more works of an author. In this paper, we present BolVis, a visualization tool for text-based research in philosophy. BolVis allows researchers to determine quickly which parts of a text corpus are most relevant for their research by performing a semantic similarity search on words, sentences, and passages. It supports activities such as filtering, exploring the semantic context, comparing, performing close reading on selected passages, et cetera. Our approach enables in-depth analysis of texts at a significantly greater scale than is possible by traditional means, thereby allowing researchers to gain in speed without compromising on precision. We demonstrate the usefulness of BolVis by applying it to a corpus consisting of about 11,000 pages of the writings of the Bohemian polymath Bernard Bolzano (1781--1848). Our use case addresses an open question about Bolzano's ideas concerning size equality for sets of natural numbers, and we show that the use of BolVis enabled us to find (at least a significant part of) the reason why he came to accept one-to-one correspondence as a sufficient criterion for size equality.},

To date, though, this research has not been reviewed systematically. This was the aim of the present review. A systematic literature search identified twelve eligible studies yielding an aggregated sample size of 13,389. Eleven studies reported significant group differences in one or multiple Big Five personality traits. Consistent findings across studies were that students of arts/humanities and psychology scored high on Neuroticism and Openness; students of political sc. scored high on Openness; students of economics, law, political sc., and medicine scored high on Extraversion; students of medicine, psychology, arts/humanities, and sciences scored high on Agreeableness; and students of arts/humanities scored low on Conscientiousness. Effect sizes were calculated to estimate the magnitude of the personality group differences. These effect sizes were consistent across studies comparing similar pairs of academic majors. For all Big Five personality traits medium effect sizes were found frequently, and for Openness even large effect sizes were found regularly. The results from the present review indicate that substantial personality group differences across academic majors exist. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {The Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism) have been associated with the desire for power, status, and social dominance in the workplace, and these desires have been hypothesized to draw Dark Triad individuals towards occupations affording such outcomes. Following this reasoning, the Dark Triad may also influence educational choices. Research in other personality traits has shown that Big Five traits impact educational choices: Students in different academic majors differ on Big Five traits at enrollment. The aim of the present study was to explore whether there are also pre-existing Dark Triad differences across academic majors. Accordingly, the Big Five and the Dark Triad traits were measured in a sample of newly enrolled students (N = 487) in different academic majors (psychology, economics/business, law, and political science), and mean scores were compared. Group differences in the Big Five personality traits largely replicated previous findings. Group differences in the Dark Triad traits were also found and included medium and large effect sizes with the largest differences being between economics/business students (having high Dark Triad scores) and psychology students (having low Dark Triad scores). These findings indicate that Dark Triad as well as Big Five traits may influence educational choices.},

Most scientific pluralists, however, focus on the plurality of theories, explanations, or mechanisms, while other potential targets of plurality that the philosophy of scientific practice has particularly emphasized have so far not received extensive treatment. How should we approach such practice-based candidates of plurality? And what are potential pluralist positions concerning the objects of scientific practice? In this article, I set out to answer these questions. I combine approaching a widely influential topic within the philosophy of science, scientific pluralism, with social science methodology. Using interview data combined with sociological analysis, I provide a nuanced picture of the dynamics of one particular research field that displays plurality. Focusing on how sociological configurations resonate with intellectual commitments within a research field, I disentangle practice-based from theoretical plurality. I consider how these empirical results should feedback on the scientific pluralism literature.},

We investigate the influence of UMAP parameters---such as, correlation distance, minimum embedding distance, as well as number of embedding neighbors--- on the reduction and visualization of spectral images collected from Po{\`e}mes Barbares (1896), a major work by the French artist Paul Gauguin in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums. The use of a cosine distance metric and number of neighbors equal to 10 preserves both the local and global structure of the Gauguin dataset in a reduced two-dimensional embedding space thus yielding simple and clear groupings of the pigments used by the artist. The centroids of these groups were identified by locating the densest regions within the UMAP embedding through a 2D histogram peak finding algorithm. These centroids were subsequently fit to the dataset by non-negative least square thus forming maps of pigments distributed across the work of art studied. All findings were correlated to macro XRF imaging analyses carried out on the same painting. The described procedure for reduction and visualization of spectral images of a work of art is quick, easy to implement, and the software is opensource thus promising an improved strategy for interrogating reflectance images from complex works of art.},

I argue that the modal notions of actuality and possibility provide the relevant dividing lines between how-possibly and how-actually explanations. Whereas how-possibly explanations establish claims of possible explanations, how-actually explanations establish claims of actual ones. Models, in turn, simply provide evidence for these claims.},

Philosophy, science, and art are three distinct forms of reliable thinking. Given the heterogeneity of thinking, in what sense can the three distinct forms of thinking answer the problem of creating concepts and using the machine as an allegory? This essay aims to analyse philosophy's role in its relation to artistic and scientific practices by examining Dziga Vertov's Man with a Moving Camera (1929). It will focus on three guiding principles: creation is not exclusive to art and the sensible; philosophy mediates the relation between art and the sciences; and this mediation aims to keep their discord alive, not to solve it.},

We argue that corruption is fruitfully understood as a collective action problem that happens between embedded people and organizations. Computational methods like network science and agent-based modeling can give insights into such situations. We also present various (big) data sources that have been exploited to study corruption. We conclude by highlighting work in adjacent fields, for instance on the problems of collusion, tax evasion, organized crime, and the darkweb, and promising avenues for future work.},

It refines the distant reading technique of topic modelling (TM) by using the discourse-historical approach (DHA------Wodak, 2001) in order to analyse the mechanisms underlying discursive practices in historical newspapers. Specifically, we investigate public discourses produced by Italian minorities and test the methodology on a corpus of digitized Italian ethnic newspapers published in the USA between 1898 and 1920 (ChroniclItaly---Viola, 2018). This combined methodology, which we suggest to label `discourse-driven topic modelling' (DDTM), enabled us to triangulate linguistic, social, and historical data and to examine how the changing experience of migration, identity construction, and assimilation was reflected over time in the accounts of the minorities themselves. The results proved DDTM to be effective in obtaining a categorization of the topics discussed in the immigrant press. The changing distribution of topics over time revealed how the Italian immigrant community negotiated their sense of connectedness with both the host country and the homeland. At the same time, without jeopardizing the analytical depth of the findings, the method proved its value of minimizing the risk of biases when identifying the topics which stemmed from the results rather than from preconceived assumptions.},

However, recent work has shown that real-world data exhibits distinct non-manifold structures, i.e. singularities, that can lead to erroneous findings. Detecting such singularities is therefore crucial as a precursor to interpolation and inference tasks. We address this issue by developing a topological framework that (i) quantifies the local intrinsic dimension, and (ii) yields a Euclidicity score for assessing the 'manifoldness' of a point along multiple scales. Our approach identifies singularities of complex spaces, while also capturing singular structures and local geometric complexity in image data.},

As a way to contribute to understanding how the junction of the two disciplines at play gave birth to a new way of studying heredity, my focus will be on the forms of representation used in genetics research at the time. More particularly, I will study the design and development, by Thomas H. Morgan's group, of the technique of linkage mapping, which embodies the integration of the Mendelian and cytological forms of representation. I will show that the design of this technique resulted in a genuine conceptual change, which should be described as a representational change, rather than merely as the introduction of new hypotheses into genetics.},

  abstract = {The simulation of population dynamics and social processes is of great interest in nonlinear systems. Recently, many scholars have paid attention to the possible applications of population dynamics models, such as the competitive Lotka-Volterra equation, in economic, demographic and social sciences. It was found that these models can describe some complex behavioral phenomena such as marital behavior, the stable marriage problem and other demographic processes, possessing chaotic dynamics under certain conditions. However, the introduction of external factors directly into the continuous system can influence its dynamic properties and requires a reformulation of the whole model. Nowadays most of the simulations are performed on digital computers. Thus, it is possible to use special numerical techniques and discrete effects to introduce additional features to the digital models of continuous systems. In this paper we propose a discrete model with controllable phase-space volume based on the competitive Lotka-Volterra equations. This model is obtained through the application of semi-implicit numerical methods with controllable symmetry to the continuous competitive Lotka-Volterra model. The proposed model provides almost linear control of the phase-space volume and, consequently, the quantitative characteristics of simulated behavior, by shifting the symmetry of the underlying finite-difference scheme. We explicitly show the possibility of introducing almost arbitrary law to control the phase-space volume and entropy of the system. The proposed approach is verified through bifurcation, time domain and phase-space volume analysis. Several possible applications of the developed model to the social and demographic problems' simulation are discussed. The developed discrete model can be broadly used in modern behavioral, demographic and social studies.},

Significant variation in its level between and within countries suggests a relationship between social structure and the prevalence of corruption, yet, large-scale empirical studies thereof have been missing due to lack of data. In this paper, we relate the structural characteristics of social capital of settlements with corruption in their local governments. Using datasets from Hungary, we quantify corruption risk by suppressed competition and lack of transparency in the settlement's awarded public contracts. We characterize social capital using social network data from a popular online platform. Controlling for social, economic and political factors, we find that settlements with fragmented social networks, indicating an excess of bonding social capital has higher corruption risk, and settlements with more diverse external connectivity, suggesting a surplus of bridging social capital is less exposed to corruption. We interpret fragmentation as fostering in-group favouritism and conformity, which increase corruption, while diversity facilitates impartiality in public life and stifles corruption.},

This literature review began with a narrow search for quantitative measures of the output of IDR that could contribute to indicators, but the authors expanded the scope of the review as it became clear that differing definitions, assessment tools, evaluation processes, and measures all shed light on different aspects of IDR. Key among these broader aspects is (a) the importance of incorporating the concept of knowledge integration, and (b) recognizing that integration can occur within a single mind as well as among a team. Existing output measures alone cannot adequately capture this process. Among the quantitative measures considered, bibliometrics (co-authorships, co-inventors, collaborations, references, citations and co-citations) are the most developed, but leave considerable gaps in understanding of the social dynamics that lead to knowledge integration. Emerging measures in network dynamics (particularly betweenness centrality and diversity), and entropy are promising as indicators, but their use requires sophisticated interpretations. Combinations of quantitative measures and qualitative assessments being applied within evaluation studies appear to reveal IDR processes but carry burdens of expense, intrusion, and lack of reproducibility year-upon-year. This review is a first step toward providing a more holistic view of measuring IDR, although research and development is needed before metrics can adequately reflect the actual phenomenon of IDR.},

  abstract = {Animals actively move their sensory organs in order to acquire sensory information. Some rodents, such as mice and rats, employ cyclic scanning motions of their facial whiskers to explore their proximal surrounding, a behavior known as whisking. Here we investigated the contingency of whisking kinematics on the animal's behavioral context that arises from both internal processes (attention and expectations) and external constraints (available sensory and motor degrees of freedom). We recorded rat whisking at high temporal resolution in two experimental contexts - freely moving or head-fixed -- and two spatial sensory configurations -- a single row or three caudal whiskers on each side of the snout. We found that rapid sensorimotor twitches, called pumps, occurring during free-air whisking carry information about the rat's upcoming exploratory direction, as demonstrated by the ability of these pumps to predict consequent head and body locomotion. Specifically, pump behavior during both voluntary motionlessness and imposed head-fixation exposed a backward redistribution of sensorimotor exploratory resources. Further, head-fixed rats employed a wide range of whisking profiles to compensate for the loss of head- and body-motor degrees of freedom. Finally, changing the number of intact vibrissae available to a rat resulted in an alteration of whisking strategy consistent with the rat actively reallocating its remaining resources. In sum, this work shows that rats adapt their active exploratory behavior in a ``homeostatic'' attempt to preserve sensorimotor coverage under changing environmental conditions and changing sensory capacities, including those imposed by various laboratory conditions.},

  abstract = {Optimism about the Internet's potential to bring the world together has been tempered by concerns about its role in inflaming the ``culture wars''. Via mass selection into like-minded groups, online society may be becoming more fragmented and polarized, particularly with respect to partisan differences. However, our ability to measure the cultural makeup of online communities, and in turn understand the cultural structure of online platforms, is limited by the pseudonymous, unstructured, and large-scale nature of digital discussion. Here we develop a neural embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online communities along cultural dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 4.8B Reddit comments made in 10K communities over 14 years, we find that the macro-scale community structure is organized along cultural lines, and that relationships between online cultural concepts are more complex than simply reflecting their offline analogues. Examining political content, we show Reddit underwent a significant polarization event around the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and remained highly polarized for years afterward. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, instances of individual users becoming more polarized over time are rare; the majority of platform-level polarization is driven by the arrival of new and newly political users. Our methodology is broadly applicable to the study of online culture, and our findings have implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the cultural contexts of online content, and quantifying cultural shifts in online behaviour.},

  abstract = {There are many different relatedness measures, based for instance on citation relations or textual similarity, that can be used to cluster scientific publications. We propose a principled methodology for evaluating the accuracy of clustering solutions obtained using these relatedness measures. We formally show that the proposed methodology has an important consistency property. The empirical analyses that we present are based on publications in the fields of cell biology, condensed matter physics, and economics. Using the BM25 text-based relatedness measure as evaluation criterion, we find that bibliographic coupling relations yield more accurate clustering solutions than direct citation relations and co-citation relations. The so-called extended direct citation approach performs similarly to or slightly better than bibliographic coupling in terms of the accuracy of the resulting clustering solutions. The other way around, using a citation-based relatedness measure as evaluation criterion, BM25 turns out to yield more accurate clustering solutions than other text-based relatedness measures.},

Recent research suggests the key may lie in multi-headed attention mechanism's ability to learn and represent linguistic information. Understanding how these models represent both syntactic and semantic knowledge is vital to investigate why they succeed and fail, what they have learned, and how they can improve. We present Dodrio, an open-source interactive visualization tool to help NLP researchers and practitioners analyze attention mechanisms in transformer-based models with linguistic knowledge. Dodrio tightly integrates an overview that summarizes the roles of different attention heads, and detailed views that help users compare attention weights with the syntactic structure and semantic information in the input text. To facilitate the visual comparison of attention weights and linguistic knowledge, Dodrio applies different graph visualization techniques to represent attention weights with longer input text. Case studies highlight how Dodrio provides insights into understanding the attention mechanism in transformer-based models. Dodrio is available at https://poloclub.github.io/dodrio/.},

For a nuanced analysis of gender homophily, we develop methodology necessitated by the fact that the data comprises heterogeneous sub-disciplines and that not all authorships are exchangeable. In particular, we distinguish three components of gender homophily in collaborations: a structural component that is due to demographics and non-gendered authorship norms of a scholarly community, a compositional component which is driven by varying gender representation across sub-disciplines, and a behavioral component which we define as the remainder of observed homophily after its structural and compositional components have been taken into account. Using minimal modeling assumptions, we measure and test for behavioral homophily. We find that significant behavioral homophily can be detected across the JSTOR corpus and show that this finding is robust to missing gender indicators in our data. In a secondary analysis, we show that the proportion of female representation in a field is positively associated with significant behavioral homophily.},

  abstract = {Dense retrieval approaches can overcome the lexical gap and lead to significantly improved search results. However, they require large amounts of training data which is not available for most domains. As shown in previous work (Thakur et al., 2021b), the performance of dense retrievers severely degrades under a domain shift. This limits the usage of dense retrieval approaches to only a few domains with large training datasets. In this paper, we propose the novel unsupervised domain adaptation method Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL), which combines a query generator with pseudo labeling from a cross-encoder. On six representative domain-specialized datasets, we find the proposed GPL can outperform an out-of-the-box state-of-the-art dense retrieval approach by up to 9.3 points nDCG@10. GPL requires less (unlabeled) data from the target domain and is more robust in its training than previous methods. We further investigate the role of six recent pre-training methods in the scenario of domain adaptation for retrieval tasks, where only three could yield improved results. The best approach, TSDAE (Wang et al., 2021) can be combined with GPL, yielding another average improvement of 1.4 points nDCG@10 across the six tasks. The code and the models are available at https://github.com/UKPLab/gpl.},

  abstract = {The core and hard part of Mathematical Information Retrieval (MathIR) is formula retrieval. The datasets used for formula retrieval are usually scientific documents containing formulas. However, there is a lack of labeled datasets specifically for formula similarity. Contrastive learning can learn general features of datasets from unlabeled data and autonomously discover latent structures in the data. Furthermore, dense retrieval methods based on bi-encoders have gained increasing attention. Therefore, we propose CLFE, a simple framework for contrastive learning of formula embeddings. It can learn the latent structure and content information of formulas from unlabeled formulas and generate formula embeddings for formula retrieval. We design two frameworks, Contrastive Presentation MathML-Content MathML Learning and Contrastive LaTeX-MathML Learning, which initialize the encoders using transformer-based models and can produce superior LaTeX, Presentation MathML, and Content MathML embeddings for each formula. The combination of these three embeddings results in the Add embedding and Concat embedding. Finally, the formula retrieval task is achieved by finding the k nearest formulas in the vector space through nearest neighbor search. Experimental results show that when applying our proposed method on the NTCIR-12 dataset to retrieve 20 non-wildcard formulas and scoring the top-10 results, the highest achieved scores for mean P@10, mean nDCG@10, and MAP@10 are 0.6250, 0.9792, and 0.9381.},

  abstract = {Neyman-Scott processes (NSPs) are point process models that generate clusters of points in time or space. They are natural models for a wide range of phenomena, ranging from neural spike trains to document streams. The clustering property is achieved via a doubly stochastic formulation: first, a set of latent events is drawn from a Poisson process; then, each latent event generates a set of observed data points according to another Poisson process. This construction is similar to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models like the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in that the number of latent events (i.e. clusters) is a random variable, but the point process formulation makes the NSP especially well suited to modeling spatiotemporal data. While many specialized algorithms have been developed for DPMMs, comparatively fewer works have focused on inference in NSPs. Here, we present novel connections between NSPs and DPMMs, with the key link being a third class of Bayesian mixture models called mixture of finite mixture models (MFMMs). Leveraging this connection, we adapt the standard collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for DPMMs to enable scalable Bayesian inference on NSP models. We demonstrate the potential of Neyman-Scott processes on a variety of applications including sequence detection in neural spike trains and event detection in document streams.},

One tension that has always faced these methods is the trade-off between preservation of global structure and preservation of local structure: these methods can either handle one or the other, but not both. In this work, our main goal is to understand what aspects of DR methods are important for preserving both local and global structure: it is difficult to design a better method without a true understanding of the choices we make in our algorithms and their empirical impact on the lower-dimensional embeddings they produce. Towards the goal of local structure preservation, we provide several useful design principles for DR loss functions based on our new understanding of the mechanisms behind successful DR methods. Towards the goal of global structure preservation, our analysis illuminates that the choice of which components to preserve is important. We leverage these insights to design a new algorithm for DR, called Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PaCMAP), which preserves both local and global structure. Our work provides several unexpected insights into what design choices both to make and avoid when constructing DR algorithms.},

Although such models enjoy widespread adoption, the variability in their embeddings remains poorly understood, resulting in unnecessary complexity and untrustworthy representations. Our framework uses persistent homology to characterize the latent spaces arising from different combinations of diverse machine-learning methods, (hyper)parameter configurations, and datasets, allowing us to measure their pairwise (dis)similarity and statistically reason about their distributions. As we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically, our pipeline preserves desirable properties of collections of latent representations, and it can be leveraged to perform sensitivity analysis, detect anomalous embeddings, or efficiently and effectively navigate hyperparameter search spaces.},

This preference for conformity interacts with the agents' beliefs about which of two (or more) possible actions yields the better result. We find a range of possible outcomes, including stable polarization in belief and action. The model results are sensitive to network structure. In general, though, conformity has a negative effect on a community's ability to reach accurate consensus about the world.},

We developed an annotation tagset for the 'literary comment' -- a frequently used but rarely defined concept -- and its subtypes (interpretative comment, attitude comment and metanarrative / metafictional comment) and trained a multi-output and a binary classifier. The multi-output classifier shows F-scores of 28\% for attitude comment, 36\% for interpretative comment and 48\% for meta comment, whereas the binary classifier achieves F-scores up to 59\%. Crucially, both our annotation and the automatic classification struggle with the same subtypes of comment, although annotation and classification follow completely different procedures. Our findings suggest an inconsistency in the overall literary concept 'comment' and most prominently the subtypes 'attitude comment' and 'interpretative comment'. As a best-practice-example, our approach illustrates that the contribution of Digital Humanities to Literary Studies may go beyond the automatic recognition of literary phenomena.},

A team of researchers has just published their answer, based on computational text-mining of every issue of the journal~Philosophy of Science~published from 1934-2015. In ``What Is This Thing Called~Philosophy of Science? A Computational Topic-Modeling Perspective, 1934-2015,'' forthcoming in~HOPOS:~The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science, authors~Christophe Malaterre, Jean-Fran{\c c}ois Chartier, and Davide Pulizzotto (Universit{\'e} du Qu{\'e}bec {\`a} Montr{\'e}al) argue that their method complements other current historical approaches. They~say their methods make it possible to ``comprehensively analyze the semantic content of large corpuses of full-text documents, thereby providing an empirical basis for content-related studies, be they synchronic or diachronic.'' As for what they learned, and how, they write: we apply these methods to the complete full-text corpus of Philosophy of Science from its very start in 1934 up until 2015 to empirically investigate which research questions philosophers of science have been concerned with and how these questions evolved in the last 82 years. By applying topic-modeling algorithms, we identified 126 key topics that were present in the journal articles during this period. We also analyzed how these topics evolved in significance over time. Our findings concur with well-known episodes in the history of philosophy of science, such as the rise and fall of logical empiricism (1930s--1970s), but they also document other trends, such as the strong appearance of a philosophy of biology in the 1980s and mostly in the first decade of the 2000s as well as the emergence of a significant interest in models and simulations in the 1990s{\dots} These 126 topics show a great diversity of interests exhibited by philosophers of science, ranging from questions about logic and philosophy of language to issues that are usually thought of as more metaphysical, for example, natural kinds or causation, including also a broad spectrum of epistemological questions about induction, confirmation, and the scientific method. Here are some more specific findings: 16\% of the topics relate to philosophy of language, logic, and mathematics 10\% of the topics relate to the physical sciences 9\% relate to the biological sciences 12\% relate to epistemology 13\% relate to theory (regarding scientific theories, explanation)..},

We present a novel agent-based model of scientific research in which scientists divide their labor to explore an unknown epistemic landscape. Scientists aim to find the most epistemically significant research approaches. We consider three different search strategies that scientists can adopt for exploring the landscape. In the first, scientists work alone and do not let the discoveries of the community influence their actions. This is compared with two social research strategies: Followers are biased toward what others have already discovered, and we find that pure populations of these scientists do less well than scientists acting independently. However, pure populations of mavericks, who try to avoid research approaches that have already been taken, vastly outperform the other strategies. Finally, we show that, in mixed populations, mavericks stimulate followers to greater levels of epistemic production, making polymorphic populations of mavericks and followers ideal in many research domains.},

  abstract = {Many standard philosophical accounts of scientific practice fail to distinguish between modeling and other types of theory construction. This failure is unfortunate because there are important contrasts among the goals, procedures, and representations employed by modelers and other kinds of theorists. We can see some of these differences intuitively when we reflect on the methods of theorists such as Vito Volterra and Linus Pauling on the one hand, and Charles Darwin and Dimitri Mendeleev on the other. Much of Volterra's and Pauling's work involved modeling; much of Darwin's and Mendeleev's did not. In order to capture this distinction, I consider two examples of theory construction in detail: Volterra's treatment of post-WWI fishery dynamics and Mendeleev's construction of the periodic system. I argue that modeling can be distinguished from other forms of theorizing by the procedures modelers use to represent and to study real-world phenomena: indirect representation and analysis. This differentiation between modelers and non-modelers is one component of the larger project of understanding the practice of modeling, its distinctive features, and the strategies of abstraction and idealization it employs.},

Focusing on psychological and neuroscientific properties, I argue that these attacks are unsuccessful. By drawing on interspecies physiological comparisons I show that diverse physical mechanisms can converge on common functional properties at multiple levels. This is illustrated with examples from the psychophysics and neuroscience of early vision. This convergence is compatible with the existence of general constraints on the evolution of cognitive systems, and does not involve any ad hoc typing of coarse-grained higher level properties. The mechanisms that realize these common higher level properties are really distinct by the criteria laid down by critics of multiple realizability. Finally, I present an account of how such functional properties might constitute special science kinds by playing a central explanatory role in a range of cognitive models. Behavioral science kinds in particular are the functionally defined constituents picked out by our most successful models of the multilevel systems and mechanisms that explain cognitive capacities. 1{$\quad$}Reduction Versus Elimination, Redux 2{$\quad$}The Eyes of Others 3{$\quad$}Unity Through Constraint? 4{$\quad$}Justifying Taxonomic Mismatches 5{$\quad$}Further Conditions on Multiple Realization 6{$\quad$}Explanatory Taxonomy and the Special Sciences 7{$\quad$}Conclusions},

  abstract = {As civil discourse increasingly takes place online, misinformation and the polarization of news shared in online communities have become ever more relevant concerns with real world harms across our society. Studying online news sharing at scale is challenging due to the massive volume of content which is shared by millions of users across thousands of communities. Therefore, existing research has largely focused on specific communities or specific interventions, such as bans. However, understanding the prevalence and spread of misinformation and polarization more broadly, across thousands of online communities, is critical for the development of governance strategies, interventions, and community design. Here, we conduct the largest study of news sharing on reddit to date, analyzing more than 550 million links spanning 4 years. We use non-partisan news source ratings from Media Bias/Fact Check to annotate links to news sources with their political bias and factualness. We find that, compared to leftleaning communities, right-leaning communities have 105\% more variance in the political bias of their news sources, and more links to relatively-more biased sources, on average. We observe that reddit users' voting and re-sharing behaviors generally decrease the visibility of extremely biased and low factual content, which receives 20\% fewer upvotes and 30\% fewer exposures from crossposts than more neutral or more factual content. This suggests that reddit is more resilient to low factual content than Twitter. We show that extremely biased and low factual content is very concentrated, with 99\% of such content being shared in only 0.5\% of communities, giving credence to the recent strategy of community-wide bans and quarantines.},

Accurate estimation of treatment effect is difficult in most observational studies, as those collected examples are inevitably biased: distributions of sample covariates between treatment and control groups are misaligned due to experimental conditions or constraints. To address this issue, we borrow covariate shift correction techniques from the transfer machine learning community and incorporate them into weighted Gaussian process for effective bias correction. Our method can (1) correct sample bias, (2) predict both population and individual treatment effects, and (3) provide corresponding confidence intervals.},

Clusters of covarying behaviors constitute behavioral syndromes, and an individual's position along such axes of covariation is a representation of their personality. Despite these conceptual frameworks, the structure of behavioral covariation within a genotype is essentially uncharacterized and its mechanistic origins unknown. Passing hundreds of isogenic Drosophila individuals through an experimental pipeline that captured hundreds of behavioral measures, we found correlations only between sparse pairs of behaviors. Thus, the space of behavioral variation has many independent dimensions. Manipulating the physiology of the brain, and specific neural populations, altered specific correlations. We also observed that variation in gene expression can predict an individual's position on some behavior axes. This work represents the first steps in understanding the biological mechanisms determining the structure of behavioral variation within a genotype.},

In his paper, Mark Whale explores two ways of understanding Beethoven's music in line with two versions of the ``idea of culture'' proposed by literary theorist, Terry Eagleton. First, he suggests that our experience of music has to do with its association with the specific cultural ``loyalties and allegiances'' built into our lives. Second, he argues that there is a mode of musical encounter, one which crosses cultural boundaries, in which we do not simply experience music but actively choose to care about, and to attend to, what we experience. In choosing to attend carefully to Beethoven's music we discover that it invites and deepens our attention, not only to it, but also to ourselves.},

  abstract = {DHLU 2013 was co-organised by the Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe (CVCE), together with the Jean Monnet Chair in History of European Integration (University of Luxembourg, FLSHASE) and its research programme `Digital Humanities Luxembourg' --- DIHULUX (research unit Identit{\'e}s-Politiques- Soci{\'e}t{\'e}s-Espaces (IPSE)) as well as the University of Luxembourg's Master's in Contemporary European History. Its aim was to bring together likeminded researchers with a vested interest in the topic of ``Reading historical sources in the digital age''. The contributions to the symposium in this publication are structured around the following research clusters: {$\bullet$} Distant/close reading --- Data retrieval, analysis and visualization As increasing quantities of historical data are published on the web, the prospect of making simple use of these data --- i.e. reading PDFs on screen or printing them out to read on paper --- is becoming increasingly less realistic and methodologically sustainable. What options are open to researchers, and what are the concomitant methodological issues? This cluster will cover various themes, including: (big) data, text mining and semantic analysis, quantitative data approaches, network analysis, data visualization (including GIS), and more generally the links between distant and close readings. {$\bullet$} Writing history \& Assessing scholarship Once researchers begin to use digital thematic collections, will it change the way they write history? This cluster includes practical papers (e.g. on how to cite digital resources) as well as more theoretical ones. It embraces issues relating to the validity and quality of data and research outputs based on digital thematic collections, as well as the evaluation of those collections as a new kind of online scholarly publication. Based on the above clusters, researchers were asked to submit papers in an open call. We challenged them to bridge the gap in Digital Humanities knowledge and share their methodological, scholarly activities and experience of handling digital historical sources. This publication results from a selection of presentations at the symposium. The papers presented therein where fully revised and updated in order to form this volume.}

To improve confidence about the extent to which shared environment exerts enduring effects on IQ, we estimated genetic and environmental effects on adulthood IQ in a unique sample of 486 biological and adoptive families. These families, tested previously on measures of IQ when offspring averaged age 15, were assessed a second time nearly two decades later (M offspring age~=~32~years). We estimated the proportions of the variance in IQ attributable to environmentally mediated effects of parental IQs, sibling-specific shared environment, and gene-environment covariance to be 0.01 [95\% CI 0.00, 0.02], 0.04 [95\% CI 0.00, 0.15], and 0.03 [95\% CI 0.00, 0.07] respectively; these components jointly accounted for 8\% of the IQ variance in adulthood. The heritability was estimated to be 0.42 [95\% CI 0.21, 0.64]. Together, these findings provide further evidence for the predominance of genetic influences on adult intelligence over any other systematic source of variation.},

We also argue that these social models must accommodate the fact that the various agents in a collaborative project often have ineliminable, messy, and conflicting interests and values; any story about accountability in a massively distributed collaboration must therefore involve models of such interests and values and their methodological and epistemic effects.},

In particular, careful reflection is needed on the scientific study of the origins of Homo sapiens, the division of current human populations into ethnicities, populations, or races, and the potential impact of genomics on personalized medicine. Genomic approaches to the origins and divisions of our species are among the most multi-dimensional areas of contemporary science, combining mathematical modeling, computer science, medicine, bioethics, and philosophy of biology. The best evidence suggests that we are a young species, with a cradle in Africa. While prejudice, misunderstanding, and violence grow in many corners of the world, our best genomic science suggests a deep biological connection among all peoples.}

While mathematically consistent, these two methodologies are understood by many to ground diametrically opposed claims about the reality of human races. Moreover, modeling results are sensitive to assumptions such as preexisting theoretical commitments to certain linguistic, anthropological, and geographic human groups. Thus, models can be perniciously reified. That is, they can be conflated and confused with the world. This fact belies standard realist and antirealist interpretations of ``race,'' and supports a pluralist conventionalist interpretation.},

Guided by concepts from the sociology of knowledge and status theories, we highlight the importance of a field's size and age for processes of stratification and segregation within it. Our findings suggest that stratification becomes stronger and diversifies as the field of neuroblastoma research expands. Moreover, we find that the occurrence of collaboration between researchers with a similar status becomes more likely as the field matures. While previous work has primarily examined established fields, our study focuses on how scientific fields change their structure over time. More broadly, our article demonstrates the potential analytical merits of adopting a dynamic and relational perspective on the developmental trajectories of organizational and cultural fields.},

  abstract = {In Objectivity (2007), Daston and Galison argue that scientific objectivity has a history. Objectivity emerged as a distinct nineteenth-century ``epistemic virtue,'' flanked in time by other epistemic virtues. The authors trace the origins of scientific objectivity by identifying changes in images from scientific atlases from different periods, but they emphasize that the same history could be narrated using different sorts of scientific objects. One could, for example, focus on the changing uses of ``type specimens'' in biological taxonomy. Daston (Crit Inq 31(1):153--182, 2004) indeed provides a detailed account of the history of the type specimen which purports to show this. I argue that this attempt hinges on a conceptual confusion and therefore fails. I show that the actual history of the type specimen does not reinforce the account of epistemic virtues from Objectivity, but rather threatens to subvert it.},

Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents;researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.}

My aim in this paper is to provide such an analysis.

We discovered that philosophy of science, a sub-field in the humanities, differs significantly from other fields examined with this method. Books play a more important role in philosophy of science than in the sciences. Further, Einstein's famous 1905 papers created a citation peak in the philosophy of science literature. But rather than being a contribution to the philosophy of science, their importance lies in the fact that they are revolutionary contributions to physics with important implications for philosophy of science.},

If all scientists perform the same tests in their research, they might miss important insights that other tests would yield. If all scientists adhere to the same theories, they might fail to explore other options which, in turn, might be superior. But the mechanisms that lead to this sort of diversity can also generate epistemic harms when scientific communities fail to reach swift consensus on successful theories. In this paper, we draw on extant literature using network models to investigate diversity in science. We evaluate different mechanisms from the modeling literature that can promote transient diversity of practice, keeping in mind ethical and practical constraints posed by real epistemic communities. We ask: what are the best ways to promote an appropriate amount of diversity of practice in scientific communities?},

The development of natural language processing (NLP) tools, such as GPT-4, can accelerate the extraction of published information related to microbial performance under complex strain engineering and bioreactor conditions. As a proof of concept, we proposed prompt engineering for a GPT-4 workflow pipeline to extract knowledge from 176 publications on two oleaginous yeasts (Yarrowia lipolytica and Rhodosporidium toruloides). After human intervention, the pipeline obtained a total of 2037 data instances. The structured data sets and feature selections enabled ML approaches (e.g., a random forest model) to predict Yarrowia fermentation titers with decent accuracy (R2 of 0.86 for unseen test data). Via transfer learning, the trained model could assess the production potential of the engineered nonconventional yeast, R. toruloides, for which there are fewer published reports. This work demonstrated the potential of generative artificial intelligence to streamline information extraction from research articles, thereby facilitating fermentation predictions and biomanufacturing development.}

To generate semantically-faithful embeddings, we develop techniques to recognize node heterogeneity, and semantic regularization that incorporate structural constraints into the embedding. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of models trained to perform entailment checking and visual relation prediction. Interestingly, we observe a connection between the tractability of the propositional theory representation and the ease of embedding. Future exploration of this connection may elucidate the relationship between knowledge compilation and vector representation learning.},

  abstract = {The structure of a population strongly influences its evolutionary dynamics. In various settings ranging from biology to social systems, individuals tend to interact more often with those present in their proximity and rarely with those far away. A common approach to model the structure of a population is Evolutionary Graph Theory. In this framework, each graph node is occupied by a reproducing individual. The links connect these individuals to their neighbours. The offspring can be placed on neighbouring nodes, replacing the neighbours -- or the progeny of its neighbours can replace a node during the course of ongoing evolutionary dynamics. Extending this theory by replacing single individuals with subpopulations at nodes yields a graph-structured metapopulation. The dynamics between the different local subpopulations is set by an update mechanism. There are many such update mechanisms. Here, we classify update mechanisms for structured metapopulations, which allows to find commonalities between past work and illustrate directions for further research and current gaps of investigation.},

We define new combinations as new pairs of knowledge elements in a related research area, and new components as new knowledge elements that have never appeared in a related research area previously. The importance of both dimensions is stressed, and we analyze the mechanisms that affect the frequency of a paper's citation; we believe that a paper's new combinations and new components both have an inverted U-shaped effect on its citation count. Utilizing a text-mining approach, we develop a novel method for constructing new combinations and new components using a paper's keywords. Using keywords from papers published in the wind energy field between 2002 and 2015 as our sample, we conduct an empirical analysis on the above-mentioned relationships. To do so, we use the negative binomial regression method and several robustness tests. The results provide support for our hypotheses that propose a paper's new combinations and new components significantly affect its impact. Specifically, new combinations and new components lead to more citation counts up to a specific threshold. When the number of new combinations and new components exceed the threshold, the paper is likely to be cited less frequently. Finally, we discuss the theoretical contributions, methodological contributions, and practical implications of these findings.},

By studying word evolution, we can infer social trends and language constructs over different periods of human history. However, traditional techniques such as word representation learning do not adequately capture the evolving language structure and vocabulary. In this paper, we develop a dynamic statistical model to learn time-aware word vector representation. We propose a model that simultaneously learns time-aware embeddings and solves the resulting ``alignment problem''. This model is trained on a crawled NYTimes dataset. Additionally, we develop multiple intuitive evaluation strategies of temporal word embeddings. Our qualitative and quantitative tests indicate that our method not only reliably captures this evolution over time, but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art temporal embedding approaches on both semantic accuracy and alignment quality.},

The main idea behind our method is to visualize a joint embedding of the query and key vectors used by transformer models to compute attention. Unlike previous attention visualization techniques, our approach enables the analysis of global patterns across multiple input sequences. We create an interactive visualization tool, AttentionViz, based on these joint query-key embeddings, and use it to study attention mechanisms in both language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in improving model understanding and offering new insights about query-key interactions through several application scenarios and expert feedback.},

  abstract = {Most previous works on opinion modeling lack the simultaneous study of individual mental activity and group behavior. This paper is motivated to propose an agent-based online opinion formation model based on attitude change theory, group behavior theory and evolutionary game theory in the perspective of sociology and psychology. In this model, there are three factors influencing the persuasion process, including credibility of the leaders, characteristic of the recipient, and group environment. The proposed model is applied to Twitter to analyze the influence of topic type, parameter changing, and opinion leaders on opinion formation. Experimental results show that the opinion evolution of controversial topic shows greater uncertainty and sustainability. The ratio of benefit to cost has a significant impact on opinion formation and a moderate ratio will result in the longest relaxation time or most unified global opinions. Furthermore, celebrities with a large number of followers are more capable of influencing public opinion than experts. This paper enriches the researches on opinion formation modeling, and the results provide managerial insights for business on public relations and market prediction.},

  abstract = {Objectives The objective of this study was to estimate the features of suicide rate and its association with economic development and stock market during the past decade in the People's Republic of China. Methods Official data were gathered and analyzed in the People's Republic of China during the period 2004--2013. Nationwide suicide rate was stratified by four year age-groups, sex, urban/rural areas, and regions (East, Central, and West). Annual economic indexes including gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and rural and urban income per capita were all adjusted for inflation. Variation coefficient of market index (VCMI) was also included as an economic index to measure the fluctuation of the stock market. Negative binomial regression was performed to examine the time trend of region-level suicide rates and effects of sex, age, urban/rural area, region, and economic index on the suicide rates. Results Suicide rates of each age-group, sex, urban/rural area, and region were generally decreased from 2004 to 2013, while annual GDP per capita and rural and urban income per capita were generally increased by year. VCMI fluctuated largely, which peaked around 2009 and decreased after that time. Negative binomial regression showed that the decreased suicide rate in East and Central rural areas was the main cause of the decrease in suicide rate in the People's Republic of China. Suicide rate in the People's Republic of China for the study period increased with age and was higher in rural than in urban area, higher in males than in females, and the highest in the Central region. When GDP per capita increased by 2,787 RMB, the suicide rate decreased by 0.498 times. VCMI showed no significant relationship with suicide rate in the negative binomial regression. Conclusion Suicide rate decreased in 2004--2013; varied among different age-groups, sex, urban/rural areas, and regions; and was negatively associated with the economic growth in the People's Republic of China. Stock market showed no relationship with suicide rate, but this finding needs to be verified in a future study.},

We argue that the epistemic contribution of theoretical models can be better understood in the context of a cluster of models relevant to the explanatory task at hand. The central claim of the paper is that theoretical models make better sense in the context of a menu of possible explanations. In order to justify this claim, we introduce a distinction between causal scenarios and causal mechanism schemes. These conceptual tools help us to articulate the basis for modelers' intuitive confidence that their models make an important epistemic contribution. By focusing on the role of the menu of possible explanations in the evaluation of explanatory hypotheses, it is possible to understand how a causal mechanism scheme can improve our explanatory understanding even in cases where it does not describe the actual cause of a particular phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Scholars frequently employ relatedness measures to estimate the similarity between two different items (e.g., documents, authors, and institutes). Such relatedness measures are commonly based on overlapping references (i.e., bibliographic coupling) or citations (i.e., co-citation) and can then be used with cluster analysis to find boundaries between research fields. Unfortunately, calculating a relatedness measure is challenging, especially for a large number of items, because the computational complexity is greater than linear. We propose an alternative method for identifying the research front that uses direct citation inspired by relatedness measures. Our novel approach simply replicates a node into two distinct nodes: a citing node and cited node. We then apply typical clustering methods to the modified network. Clusters of citing nodes should emulate those from the bibliographic coupling relatedness network, while clusters of cited nodes should act like those from the co-citation relatedness network. In validation tests, our proposed method demonstrated high levels of similarity with conventional relatedness-based methods. We also found that the clustering results of proposed method outperformed those of conventional relatedness-based measures regarding similarity with natural language processing--based classification.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we model the diffusion of scientific knowledge embodied in the textbooks of the Sphaera corpus. This corpus consists of more than 350 different editions of textbooks used for teaching astronomy in European universities during the early modern period. Connections between the editions are based on mutual semantic knowledge and are arranged in a multiplex network of four layers, with each layer representing a different semantic relation. The modeling aims for a better understanding (and possible prediction) of the process of knowledge accumulation in the various editions. We consider semantic text-parts as knowledge units transferred between the editions, and show how these units spread using both an SI model and its modified version, the Bass model. Both models include a parameter representing the rate of transfer, which is interpreted as the mechanism underlying the process of knowledge accumulation; the Bass model has an extra parameter that represents the rate of external influence and stands out as the ``resistance to adoption from'' and ``resistance to be influenced by'' other knowledge systems. The modeling has helped us to chart the path and mechanisms of knowledge transformation in the early modern period. Networks are identified by adding further layers whose graphs express socioeconomic relationships and conditional sub-networks. The comparison between the model and these layers enables us to conclude that the accumulation of knowledge was highly dependent on the institutional embedding of scientific production because the diffusion of knowledge was mostly determined by the economic constraints of early modern printers and publishers. It further suggests that geographic proximity played a role---although secondary---in the diffusion of knowledge but only under the condition that the book producers involved were still living. The transformation of early modern scientific knowledge is, therefore, highly dependent on the institutional and economic contexts of the book producers.},

Traditional NER models are effective but limited to a set of predefined entity types. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) can extract arbitrary entities through natural language instructions, offering greater flexibility. However, their size and cost, particularly for those accessed via APIs like ChatGPT, make them impractical in resource-limited scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a compact NER model trained to identify any type of entity. Leveraging a bidirectional transformer encoder, our model, GLiNER, facilitates parallel entity extraction, an advantage over the slow sequential token generation of LLMs. Through comprehensive testing, GLiNER demonstrate strong performance, outperforming both ChatGPT and fine-tuned LLMs in zero-shot evaluations on various NER benchmarks.},

We present an unprecedented analysis of the international film festival circuit, which has so far remained relatively understudied quantitatively, partly due to the limited availability of suitable data sets. We use large-scale data from the Cinando platform of the Cannes Film Market, widely used by industry professionals. We explicitly model festival events as a global network connected by shared films, and quantify festivals as aggregates of the metadata of their showcased films. Importantly, we argue against using simple count distributions for discrete labels such as language or production country, as such categories are typically not equidistant. Rather, we propose embedding them in continuous latent vector spaces. We demonstrate how these ``festival embeddings'' provide insight into changes in programmed content over time, predict festival connections, and can be used to measure diversity in film festival programming across various cultural, social, and geographical variables---which all constitute an aspect of public value creation by film festivals. Our results provide a novel mapping of the film festival circuit between 2009--2021 (616 festivals, 31,989 unique films), highlighting festival types that occupy specific niches, diverse series, and those that evolve over time. We also discuss how these quantitative findings fit into media studies and research on public value creation by cultural industries. With festivals occupying a central position in the film industry, investigations into the data they generate hold opportunities for researchers to better understand industry dynamics and cultural impact, and for organizers, policymakers, and industry actors to make more informed, data-driven decisions. We hope our proposed methodological approach to festival data paves way for more comprehensive film festival studies and large-scale quantitative cultural event analytics in general.},

  abstract = {Currently, group behaviors happen frequently with the development of network technology. As a typical social group behavior, group polarization has been attracted more and more academic attention due to its significant disturbance to public's daily lives. At present, the classic J-A (proposed by Jager and Amblard) and D-W (proposed by Deffuant and Weisbuch) models are used to analyze group polarization process. However, the main shortcomings existing in these models are that the individuals' psychology and their network relationships are rarely considered. In order to overcome the limitations, this article integrates the influence factors such as conformity and network relationship strength integrated into the polarization model. Besides, the BA (proposed by Barabasi and Albert) network model is used as the agent adjacency model due to its closer to the real social network structure. Subsequently, the experimental simulations are carried out with the multi-agent Monte-Carlo method so as to testify the efficiency and effectiveness. The results indicate that different information interaction modes have essential influence on group attitude polarization. Moreover, conformity parameters and the intensity of relationship have dual impacts on both speeding up and slowing down the polarization process.},

We explored bird macroevolution using full genomes from 48 avian species representing all major extant clades. The avian genome is principally characterized by its constrained size, which predominantly arose because of lineage-specific erosion of repetitive elements, large segmental deletions, and gene loss. Avian genomes furthermore show a remarkably high degree of evolutionary stasis at the levels of nucleotide sequence, gene synteny, and chromosomal structure. Despite this pattern of conservation, we detected many non-neutral evolutionary changes in protein-coding genes and noncoding regions. These analyses reveal that pan-avian genomic diversity covaries with adaptations to different lifestyles and convergent evolution of traits.},

  abstract = {Publicly traded companies are fundamental units of contemporary economies and markets and are important mechanisms through which humans interact with their environments. Understanding the general properties that underlie the processes of their growth has long been of interest, yet fundamental debates about the effects of firm size on growth have persisted. Here we develop a scaling framework that focuses on company size as the critical feature determining a variety of tradeoffs, and use this to reveal novel systematic behavior across the diversity of publicly-traded companies. Using a large database of 31,553 US companies over nearly 70 years, and 3,160 Chinese companies over 24 year, we show how the dynamics of companies expressed as scaling relationships leads to a quantitative, analytic theory for their growth. This theory produces several predictions that are in good agreement with data for both the US and China, whose markets have strikingly different histories and underlying structures. In both cases sales scale sublinearly with assets and exhibit nearly identical exponents leading, surprisingly and nontrivially, to assets that grow as a power law in time rather than exponentially, as often assumed. On the other hand, liabilities scale linearly in the US (exponent of \$1.0\$) but superlinearly in China (exponent of \$1.09\$). We show that such small differences in scaling exponents can have a significant impact on the character and long-term evolution of growth trajectories. These results illustrate that while companies are part of a larger class of growth phenomena driven by incomes and costs that scale with size, they are unique in that they grow following a temporal power-function which sets them apart from organisms, cities, nations, and markets, whose growth over time is often exponential.},

  abstract = {Ordinal data are common in many data mining and machine learning tasks. Compared to nominal data, the possible values (also called categories interchangeably) of an ordinal attribute are naturally ordered. Nevertheless, since the data values are not quantitative, the distance between two categories of an ordinal attribute is generally not well defined, which surely has a serious impact on the result of the quantitative analysis if an inappropriate distance metric is utilized. From the practical perspective, ordinal-and-nominal-attribute categorical data, i.e., categorical data associated with a mixture of nominal and ordinal attributes, is common, but the distance metric for such data has yet to be well explored in the literature. In this paper, within the framework of clustering analysis, we therefore first propose an entropy-based distance metric for ordinal attributes, which exploits the underlying order information among categories of an ordinal attribute for the distance measurement. Then, we generalize this distance metric and propose a unified one accordingly, which is applicable to ordinal-and-nominal-attribute categorical data. Compared with the existing metrics proposed for categorical data, the proposed metric is simple to use and nonparametric. More importantly, it reasonably exploits the underlying order information of ordinal attributes and statistical information of nominal attributes for distance measurement. Extensive experiments show that the proposed metric outperforms the existing counterparts on both the real and benchmark data sets.},

  abstract = {Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning deals with binary classification problems when only positive (P) and unlabeled (U) data are available. Many recent PU methods are based on neural networks, but little has been done to develop boosting algorithms for PU learning, despite boosting algorithms' strong performance on many fully supervised classification problems. In this paper, we propose a novel boosting algorithm, AdaPU, for PU learning. Similarly to AdaBoost, AdaPU aims to optimize an empirical exponential loss, but the loss is based on the PU data, rather than on positive-negative (PN) data. As in AdaBoost, we learn a weighted combination of weak classifiers by learning one weak classifier and its weight at a time. However, AdaPU requires a very different algorithm for learning the weak classifiers and determining their weights. This is because AdaPU learns a weak classifier and its weight using a weighted positive-negative (PN) dataset with some negative data weights \$-\$ the dataset is derived from the original PU data, and the data weights are determined by the current weighted classifier combination, but some data weights are negative. Our experiments showed that AdaPU outperforms neural networks on several benchmark PU datasets, including a large-scale challenging cyber security dataset.},

  abstract = {Structural connectivity in the brain is typically studied by reducing its observation to a single spatial resolution. However, the brain possesses a rich architecture organized over multiple scales linked to one another. We explored the multiscale organization of human connectomes using datasets of healthy subjects reconstructed at five different resolutions. We found that the structure of the human brain remains self-similar when the resolution of observation is progressively decreased by hierarchical coarse-graining of the anatomical regions. Strikingly, a geometric network model, where distances are not Euclidean, predicts the multiscale properties of connectomes, including self-similarity. The model relies on the application of a geometric renormalization protocol which decreases the resolution by coarse-graining and averaging over short similarity distances. Our results suggest that simple organizing principles underlie the multiscale architecture of human structural brain networks, where the same connectivity law dictates short- and long-range connections between different brain regions over many resolutions. The implications are varied and can be substantial for fundamental debates, such as whether the brain is working near a critical point, as well as for applications including advanced tools to simplify the digital reconstruction and simulation of the brain.},

  abstract = {In computational social science, epidemic-inspired spread models have been widely used to simulate information diffusion. However, recent empirical studies suggest that simple epidemic-like models typically fail to generate the structure of real-world diffusion trees. Such discrepancy calls for a better understanding of how information spreads from person to person in real-world social networks. Here, we analyse comprehensive diffusion records and associated social networks in three distinct online social platforms. We find that the diffusion probability along a social tie follows a power-law relationship with the numbers of disseminator's followers and receiver's followees. To develop a more realistic model of information diffusion, we incorporate this finding together with a heterogeneous response time into a cascade model. After adjusting for observational bias, the proposed model reproduces key structural features of real-world diffusion trees across the three platforms. Our finding provides a practical approach to designing more realistic generative models of information diffusion.},

Existing approaches provide results under strong assumptions concerning unimodality of future states, or, at best, assuming specific probability distributions that often poorly fit to real-life conditions. In this work we introduce a robust and flexible probabilistic framework that allows to model future predictions with virtually no constrains regarding the modality or underlying probability distribution. To achieve this goal, we leverage a hypernetwork architecture and train a continuous normalizing flow model. The resulting method dubbed RegFlow achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, outperforming competing approaches by a significant margin.},
