## Frey and Šešelja. 2020. ‘Robustness and Idealizations in Agent-Based Models of Scientific Interaction’
https://doi.org/10.1093/bjps/axy039.
- Focus on the context of difficult inquiry to assess whether connectivity is epistemically suboptimal in difficult inquiries (as Zollman's work suggests). 
- Focus on robustness analysis under changes in the idealizing assumptions. 
- Main focus on exploratory value of modelling and simulations -- not .
- Adjustments to Zollman's model:
    - Restless bandits (probability of success of theories changes over time)
    - New interaction mechanism:
        - criticism is truth conducive
        - it occurs between proponents of rivalling theories
        - trigger: the receiver of information is affected by criticism every time she corrects her belief about the rivalling theory in a positive direction
    - Theory choice:
        - Rational inertia towards current theory
        - Threshold below which alternative theories are considered equally promising. 
- Results: 
    - Our results suggest that whether and to what extent the degree of connectedness of a scientific community impacts its efficiency is a highly context-dependent matter since different conditions deem strikingly different results.
    - Figure 10 gives a nice visualization of their results!

## Kummerfeld, and Zollman. 2016. ‘Conservatism and the Scientific State of Nature’. 
https://doi.org/10.1093/bjps/axv013.
- Adjustments to Zollman's model:
    - Scientists can intentionally keep pursuing the worse theory
- Results:
    - 

## Holman, and Bruner. 2015. ‘The Problem of Intransigently Biased Agents’. 
- Focus on adding intransigently biased agents (i.e., epistemically impure agents due to, e.g., financial interests) to a community of truth-seekers. 
- Focus on solution involving endogenous network formation.
- Results
    - Adding epistemically impure agents: higher connectivity leads to higher efficiency.
    - Adding endogenous network formation drastically increases efficiency.
