# Network epistemology
* Traditional epistemology focuses on individual rationality 
    - What is the proper response to evidence?
* Social epistemology broadens the perspective 
    - What is the proper *individual* response to testimony or disagreement?
    - Which properties of *groups* makes them better or worse epistemically?
* Network epistemology targets the structure of communication
    - Which communication *structures* are best?

## Network epistemology
* Kicked off by Zollman (2007, 2010) who uses agent-based modelling and simulations
* Main findings:
    - Less connectivity can lead to more reliable groups
    - There is a robust tradeoff between speed of convergence and reliability
* The ensuing literature has focused on whether and when high connectivity, convergence speed and conformity lead to epistemically better groups 

## Scale-free networks
* The existing literature typically focuses on three simplistic network structures: the cycle, wheel and complete network [INSERT PICTURES?]
* The epistemic value of modelling and simulations depends heavily on their empirical adequacy
* But, these simplistic network structures are rarely observed in the real world
* Real-world networks are often/virtually always *scale-free*: 
    - their degree distribution follows a power law (which is highly unequal)
* Our focus is on the *degree-equality effect*:
    - whether and when higher levels of degree equality leads to epistemically better groups

[INSERT PICTURE OR EXAMPLE OF A SCALE-FREE NETWORK?]

## Empirically sensitive robustness
* The overall aim of our study is to see whether and when the degree-equality effect is robust in an empirically sensitive way
* We aim to address three challenges:
    - Existing work in network epistemology focuses on small networks (typically up to 10 agents) whereas real scientific networks are much larger
    - Existing work in network epistemology focus on simple network structures even though virtually all empirical networks are scale-free
    - There are few attempts to empirically calibrate theoretical findings on artificial networks towards empirical networks
* We propose a two-pronged analysis by analysing both (a) artificial networks *and* (b) empirical networks

## Previous Work in Network Epistemology
* The literature on network epistemology can be (roughly) divided into:
    - A strand on robustness:
        - robustness under changes in parameter settings (Rosenstock et al., 2017), 
        - robustness under changes in modelling choices (Kummerfeld & Zollman, 2016; Frey & Šešelja, 2018, 2020; 
    - A strand on conformity: (Zollman, 2010; Mohseni & Williams, 2021; Weatherall & O’Connor, 2021; Fazelpour & Steel, 2022)
    - A strand on epistemically impure agents (including financial interests) (Holman & Bruner, 2015; Weatherall, O’Connor & Bruner, 2020)
* Our work complements this literature in at least two ways
    - we focus on the degree equality effect
    - we study empirically sensitive robustness

## One Precursor

* To the best of our knowledge there is one precursor on the degree equality effect
* Zollman (2007, Sect. 3.1) finds that 
    - the wheel does better than the complete network, which suggests that degree-inequality might be epistemically beneficial. 
    - However, since the cycle does better than the wheel, he concludes that low connectivity (not degree-inequality) produces the epistemic benefits. 
* Zollman (2007, Sect. 3.2) goes on to consider all possible networks of size 6 and finds that degree-inequality is not correlated with reliability and, hence, disconfirms the degree-inequality effect.
* Our results:
    - confirm Zollman’s finding on our artificial networks
    - but disconfirms Zollman’s finding on empirical networks
