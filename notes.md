* Beta-distributions
    * We implemented the behaviour of the agent by following the highest mean. Other options could be to take the mode or to sample from the beta-distributions
* assymmetry in experimental behaviour

* Something seems fishy because if you look at change in self.credence by state for each agent, they dont seem to change.
